        "full_text":"SATURDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1910. A DISTURBING PROSPECT. Many are the opinions and very varied the counsels of the political parties on the prospects of an early General Elec- tion. Next Januaryis the month favoured for the conflict, and Mr Haldane warns his hearers that the General Election may come as a thief in the night.\" Everything depends on the Conference. Its success may put off an election for a twelvemonth, and failure would precipi- tate the inevitable struggle. It is hoped and believed that an election may be avoided even if the Conference is abor- tive. This opinion is drawn from the idea that both parties do not desire an election, and there is a general desire to avoid the contest until the Coronation has been held. In politics as in the affairs of private life the unexpected happens, and hence Mr Haldane's warning about its coming like a thief in the night.\" The Opposition are particularly restive, for the supporters of the Conservative cause talk and act as if a Liberal Govern- ment were usurpers of office and power. The more restive of the Tory following re demanding a pledge from Mr Balfour that on a Conservative Government suc- ceeding to office one of its first measures shall be the repeal of the land taxes. I This may seem very necessary to the wealthy section of the Opposition, but ¡ nothing better could happen to help the Liberal party than such a cry at the next election. As the party have failed to pin Mr Balfour to Tariff Reform—or a plain statement of policy—it is scarcely likely that this latest attempt to rope in the Leader of the Opposition to a land taxes repeal will be more successful. There are many influences at work telling against and in favour of an immediate General Election, and it is significant that both the two great parties are pre- paring for the inevitable contest."},

        "full_text":"NATIONAL AND PRACTICAL. How necessary and desirable is it in the interests of the people of Wales that the Welsh National Memorial should be made a big success Meetings, official reports, and incidents are daily proving the need of the beneficent work which the Memorial would make possible if any evidence were needed at this day to enforce on the public mind the desira- bility of a serious attack on the terrible scourge of consumption. Dr. Williams, the County Medical Officer of Glamorgan, speaking at the Conference of Welsh Sanitary Inspectors at Penllergaer, alluded to the crusade against consump- tion, and reminded his heaters that it was not a scheme of bricks and mortar only, but a scheme beginning with the home and going through the school teaching of hygiene and the laws of health. It was an idea which included educative and preventive methods, though he had heard that there was an opinion abroad that the Memorial was to put up a building only. He connected the scheme with the food of the people and the inspection of meat and milk. Turning to the housing question, he was of opinion that they would never cope wi the disease in Merioneth and Cardiganshire—two of the blackest counties for consumption— unless they burned the hovels to the ground with fire and brimstone.\" Only a complete revolution in the housing system would do away with the con- sumptive conditions under which the people were compelled to live. All these evils will be brought to the notice of the public and the authorities by the National Memorial in such a way that further inaction on the part of the public authorities and interested parties will be impossible. The National Memorial scheme is eminently practical, and it will, if carried to a successful issue, stamp out one of the greatest plagues under which the people suffer. Everyone can help through the South Wales Daily News and Echo Shilling Fund, and the shillings of the workers will be as accept- able as the pounds of the rich. All will benefit, and all should give according to their means in this national movement for the common good."},

The boilermakers and the shipbuilders re- sumed their conference and arrived at a settlement.

Lady St. Davids' review of the work of the Association, particu- larly in South Wales, should arouse in- terest and command support from her hearers, for there is and can be no finer example of practical Christianity than this of nursing the poor of the villages. There are still parishes in South Wales where neither Queen's Jubilee Nurses nor other trained nurses are available, and no resident midwife.

This has been arranged as the result of representa- tion made to the Government, but they are ad- vised by the authorities not to wear their con- ventual habit out of doors for three months. It is explained that the decree of expulsion is a punitive one, and the authorities have never,6 had cause to complain of thesci two orders.

The master would not be in this country until April next, and he therefore applied for a further adjournment. The Board of Trade, who were concerned in two of the cases, did not object. Mr Harold Lloyd strenuously opposed the application. It was a distinct hardship that Afong should be kept here unless the owners provided for his subsistence. Mr J.

TERMS ACCEPTED BY THE MEN, AmÁss meeting of workmen of the collieries of the Ocean Coal Co. in the Upper Rhondda- Park and Dare (Cwmpark) and Maindy and Eastern (Ton Pentre)—was held Wednesday to receive the report of the deputation, consisting of Mabon, M.P., Mr John Williams, M.P., Mr D. Watts Morgan, miners' agent, and Coun- cillor W. H. Morgan, Treherbert, who waited upon Mr William Jenkins, managing director of the Ocean Coal Co., on Tuesday to discuss the various grievances of the riders and haulage men. Mr W. Abraham, M.P. (Mabon), was absent from the meeting yesterday owing to a slight indisposition. The Terms Offered. As previously reported, these collieries have been idle for ten days in consequence of the n- Unionist question and on account of a difficulty over the bonus turn which was paid to the traffic men before the introduction of the Eight Hours Act. Mr Watts Morgan said Mr Jenkins was prepared to pay one bonus turn per week to the traffic men, on condition' that they work the mealtime and overtime when emergency requires. The hauliers employed at the pit-bottom will be entitled to the same privileges as heretoforene turn per fortnight for appearing before time and working meal times, etc. There was a disposition at the meeting to have the whole of the grievances adjusted be- fore the resumption of work, but Mr Watts Morgan pointed out that Mr Jenkins had pro- mised to consider the alleged grievances of other grades of workmen affected by the extra time difficulty, and had stated that these matters would be adjusted on the same prin- ciple as the traffic shift's grievances. Mr Morgan strongly advised the men to ac- cept the terms offered, inasmuch as three- fourth of their demands had been conceded, and he submitted that Mr Jenkins' proposals were fair and reasonable, and contained the principle by which all other matters for other grades could be settled. It was resolved to accept the terms offered. The men at the Park and Dare resumed work lost night, but a difficulty presented itself somewhat unexpectedly at the Maindy and Eastern Pits, where it was found that there were still a few non-Unionists. and it was de- cided not to return to work until these had been brought into line. Another meeting will be held to-day to consider the position."},

Bruce Vaughan made the important announcement that a gentleman, who wished to remain unknown had subscribed 5,000 guineas to endow five beds in the new wing, and also that the same benefactor had given £400 towards beautifying one of the wards. Colonel Vaughan, in the coursfe of his remarks, said that some of them had contemplated the overdraft of £20,000 with serious apprehension for the future of the hospital, and especially with regard to the opening of the new wing, which would be ready in May or June of next year. We have had several princely gifts lately, continued the speaker, but none more muni- ficent, and more opportune,. than the one I announced to the House Committee the other day, of 5.000 guineas, made by a gentleman whose name will ever be associated with the history of this Hospital as one at its wisest and most princely benefactors. At present he does not wish his name to be known, but he not only promised this large sum—a small for- tune in itself—but he has promised to beau- tify one of the wards at considerable expense. There is another gift for beautifying a ward that I have the privilege and pleasure to an- nounce, and that is one from a lady whose name will be banded down to posterity, not only for her generosity to this Hospital but to many others as well, and for her constant thought for the poor and needy and all who are in sorrow and distress.\" He proposed that a hearty Vote of thanks be accorded to the lady and gentleman referred to. The secretary (Mr L. D. Rea) reported that Lady Aberdare, who had been endowing a bed in the Thompson (Women's) Ward each year, ^id now written stating that she had decided pay over the sum of £ 1,050 as a perpetual endowment. Colonel Bruce Vaughan, in supporting the hearty thanks of the committee, referred to the generosity of Lady Aberdare in regard also to the pathological theatre, to which she had contributed JtLSSOQ. He thought it would be most fitting to ask her Ladyship to perform the opening ceremony of the theatre. (Sear, hear.) ¿"},

Resolutions were being passed by the, various branches of the society to go back to the old system instead of resorting to con- ciliation and arbitration. But he urged them to take all necessary steps to avoid any more branches falling into this trap, which was laid by the railway companies. A resolution was moved by Councillor A. J.

In the Divorce Division on Thursday, before Mr Justice Hargrave Deane, Mrs Bessie Annie Lewis, of Westmorland-street, Cardiff, sought the dissolution of her marriage with her hus- band, John .1a:Dk.8 Lewis, on the ground of his cruelty and adultery. Mr Bayford, who appeared for the petitioner, said the parties were married, in February, 1898, at the parish church of Cadoxton-ju.ta..Barry, and there were four children of the marriage, two boys and two girls. From a week after the marriage bf commenced to illtreat her, and had constantly assaulted her until March, 1908, when he left for C&nada, saying he had lost money at horse-racing. Prior to that she returned home from Bargoed and met a Miss Cope leaving the house, and she made a communication to the petitioner. Subse- quently the petitioner heard that Miss Cope used to visit her husband frequently. Wheaa Mrs Lewis spoke to her husband on the point he struck her in the face, causing her to be- come unconscious. In January, 1908, he struck her on the face and arm. In that month she had written a tetter to her mother and when she refused to give it him he seized it and threw her on the ground. In March, 1908. the respondent insisted upon separate bedrooms, and in June of the same year he left with Alfred Lambert for Canada, giving as his rea- son that he had lost money over horse-racing and could not meet his liabilities. He also told her she must remain at home. He wrote her three letters that she was not to go out to him and he would send her money. As a matter of fsct he did not send her any money and she went to live with the respondent's mother for a short time, but later obtained certain inform- ation respecting Mr Lewis and a woman. In December, 1908. she instructed her solicitors in the matter and this petition was the result. The petitioner went into the witness box and bore out counsel's statement. Dr. Charles Frederick Gilbourne Sixsmith, said he had attended the petitioned on the occasions she had been assaulted by her husl band. Alfred Lambert, Ivy-street, Cardiff, said he went to Canada with the respondent. While there Miss Cope came out, lived with respon- dent, and gave birth to a child. The case being undefended, His Lordship granted a decree nisi with costs and custody of the children."},

He would always look back with great pleasure and pride to his association with Cardiff, and although he should be retiring before long from the representation of the city he should always regard with satisfaction the short period he had been its representative. (Hear, hear.) It was a very great honour to have been the member, if only for twelve months, of the capital city of Wales, and when he laid down officehe should feel he had been treated with the most generous consideration by all sections of the community.

Nash Manor, the home of the Carne Family, is one of the most interesting examples of ancient domestic architecture in the Vale of Glamorgan. There were Carnes of Nash in the 15th century, and Carnes are the possessors of the pretty old Manor House and its surround- ing landsto-day. It is not a large house, but what it may lack in respect of size it more than makes up in the matter of comfort. With the possible exception of St. Fagans Castle, we have been into no other ancient home in the County of Glamorgan, in which modern ideas of cosiness and comfort have been so skilfully introduced into a Tudor environment. NASH MANOR-THE SOUTH FRONT. (Ph<)lo. Mile< Bridgend. ) An Exposed Position. ] The main road across -1 the Vale,\" from the basin of Cowbridge, in a west and southerly direction, to ancient Llantwit, reaches its greatest altitude about midway, where for a space of nigh a mile, it is within the 300 feet contour line. It is a bleak, windswept region, with scant vegetation in most parts, so that you feel, as Carlyle did, somewhat inclined to quibble with the term \"Vale.\" But here, on the highest part of the track, where you are above the level of Penlline, you mark, upon the left-hand side of the roadway as you drive south, a patch of unexpected verdure. Some, hardened old forest trees, and gaunt Scots firs, rise behind the ancient stone wall, which once marked the confines of a stately deer park. Hre, in the breeziest of situations, stands Nash Manor, the old home of the Came family. It. is well protected on its western side by this belt of trees, and the growth of the vegetation—for all the branches point east— is indicative of the fierceness of the wind, when westerly gales roar across from Wick and the Dunraven cliffs. j NASH MANOR-HE ENTRANCE HALL. (Photo. Miles, Bridgend.) Nash Manor in Ancient Days. Nash Manor was formerly known as Little Nash,\" Osmon's Ashe,\" and sometimes the name was Latinised as Parva Fraxina.\" It was a grange or farm, within the Lordship of Llantwit, pertaining to the Bishopric of Llandaff. The early Celtic inscribed stones at Nash may be taken as evi- dence of a pre-Norman religious foundation. At a later period also, a religious community was seated there, and the chapel remains to this day. There was, of course, a monastic establishment at Monk Nash, three milesaway in a south westerly direction, and traditonally, Nash was a sisterhood in connection with it. The exact period at which Nash ceased to be occupied as a religious house is unknown. but during the 14th century it was leased under the Bishops of Llandaff by a younger branch of the Giles family, who were for i Lenturies Lords of the Manor of Gileston, and who gave to the village, the name which it still bears. j ASH MAN 6R—THE DRAWING ROOM. Note the big Ceiling Beams and t the Tudor Fireplace. (Photo, iles, Bridgend.) The Carne Family. According to the old genealogists the family of Carne sprang from that Ynyr Fychan who, tradition says, succeeded his slain brother Ithel as Prince of Gwent, ajid whose descendants, though conquered by the Norman invaders, still retained a high social position and con- siderable landed property. It is believed that the surname Carne was given to one of Ynyr's descendants from Pen Carne, which may have been either his residence or birthplace. Eighth in descent from Ynyr Fychan was Sir Thomas Carne, Knight of the Sepulchre, of Nether Gwent, and three generations later in the early 15th century, Howel Carne of Cowbridge married a daughter of John Giles of Nash. Howell Carne ob- tained a further 'lease of the Manor of Nash from Bishop John WVlls in 1432, and his grand- son who bore the same name purchased the Manor in perpetuity from Bishop George Athequa, in 1521, The second Howell Carne espoused a Kemeys of Newport. Leland, who passed that way a decade later, refers to a place caullid the Assche, and there is a park of falow deere.\" The Carries in Tudor Times. Let us digress a few moments, to take a peep at the Carnes in Tudor times, utilising as our authority, some sidelights from the Star Cham- ber cases. On one occasion Sir Rice Mansell sent three of his servants to Cow- bridge, to the house of Davyth Thomas Lloyd,\" to wait for William Carne, and they assaulted and beat him grievously. This William Carne,though of Nash,\" is supposed to have also had a house in the Market Place at Cowbridge. A year later, George Herbert of Aberga- venny and Swansea, approached Cowbridge with his retinue of eight servants, when he turned aside at St. Hilary, to pay a short visit to Sir Rice Mansell, and sent on his servants into Cowbridge. Roger Carne, with some friends, appear to have been in the public room of a hostelry there, when the Herbert servants arrived-a swaggering crowd. A Fight at Cowbridge. Evidence, given afterwards by Roger Carne, was to the effect that the Herbert retainers first insulted and then assaulted them. Roger Carne, with the pluck of his race, soon roused his townsmen, and the Herbert servants were beaten and made prisoners. George Herbert expressed his entire ignorance of the affair, but Roger Carne roundly declared that it was all prearranged, and that George Herbert had only stayed behind at St. Hilary to save being personally implicated. Another example of the way in which in those days men carried their lives in their hands was furnished on an occasion at nine o'clock one morning. John Carne and Jenkin Turberville were standing chatting in the fields watching some ploughing when six or more armed men from Cardiff Castle suddenly appeared and attacked John Carne. Having killed him, they galloped in hot haste back to C-ardift. Landmarks in the Family History. The Carne family, during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, produced men who took a leading part in events not only within, but far beyond the confines of Morganwg. Members of the family were Sheriffs of Glamorgan in 1543, 1555,1561, 1572, 1581, 1584, 1588, 1601, 1621, 1629, 1645,1690,1703, and 1731. Sir Ed- ward Carne, who was the second son of Howell Carne, was a member of Parliament and one of the Commissioners for the Crown for the suppression of the monasteries. He was Ambassador to Rome, in the matter of Queen Katherine, in the days of King Henry VIII. He died in Rome in 1561. and there is. in the Atrium of the Church of Sah Gregario in Monte Celi. a fine monument to his memory. Sir Edward purchased Ewenny Priory and from his marriage with Ann, daughter of Sir William Denis, sprang the Carnes of Ewenny. Richard Carne of Nash, the eldest brother of. Sir Edward, married an heiress of tihe Daldens. of Penarth andWenvol\", and thereby augmented; the family estates. His son, John Carne, who was living in 1561, probably rebuilt and en- larged the older portion of the house at Nash. He had a family of seven daughters, and was succeeded by his brother William, whose eldest son, Sir Edward Carne, was Receiver General of South Wales and a Teller of the Exchequer. He married a daughter of Sir Ed yi-ard Mansell of Margam, and it was he who erected the elaborate memorial to his parents, which still occupies a prominent position on the south wall of Cowbridge church. Sir Edward's grandson, Thomas Carne of Nash, married the daughter of Sir Edward Stradling of St. Donate. In the Nineteenth Centuiy. I John Carne of Nash, who represented the I thirteenth generation of the familv to reside at Nash died in 1798, leaving an only daughter, the wife of Thomas Markham, Esq., who died childless in 1842. The Nash estate then passed to her first, cousin Elizabeth, the daughter of Captain Charles Loder Ca»*ne, who had in 1800 married the Rev. Robert Nicholl of Dimlands, the youngest son of Whitlock NichoU, Esq.. of the Ham. The Rev. Robert Nicholl, his wife, and issue, as- sumed by Royal licence, the surname of Carne in 1842. They left two sons, Robert Charles Nicholl-Carne of Nash, who married but died without issue in 1869; and John Whitlock Nicholl-Carne (afterwards Stradling Came). of Dimlands and St. Donats Ca tie, D.C.L., whose son Mansel Carne inherited the Nash estate. The latter died without issue, and was succeeded by his brother, the late John Devereux Vann Loder Nicholl Carne of Nash. the father of the present representa- tive of the family, Mr Gilbert Stradling Nicholl Carne. So much for the past history of the Carne family, and their ancient Manor House. A few points now regarding Nash Manor to-day. Some Points About the Exterior. The house itself stands but a few yards from the roadway, but the trees and thick banks of evergreens screen it effectively. A short drive leads to the main front, on the way to which you pass the motor-house which was especially picturesque when wfe visited Nash. Manor a few weeks ago, in its garb of autwfmn foliage, for the big-leafed ampelopsis wfeich covers it was gorgeous in every shade .■•^m pals green and yellow to blood-red. Nash Manor faces'north and south, thr, ryain front being to the north, while the gardia ftront has a south aspect. The house is the of a letter H the cross piece and upper strokes of which form three sides of the fore court which is completed by two low walls connect- ing the east and west wings with a picturesque little gateway. A stone-paved footpath, flanked here and there by large pots of agapanthus traverses the gravelled forecourt from the en- trance gate to the front door. The east wing and the centre are the oldest portions of the house, the west wing having been added by the Jate Mr Carne about 18 or 19 years ago. Along the eastern side of the old wing there is an irregularity of outline and a picturesque succession of chimneys thoroughly Tudor in character. A Charming Environment To south, east and north the house is bounded by charming gardens. From the windows of drawing-room and the dining-room on the south front there is a broad stretch of well- trimmed turf extending on the right hand to a shrubbery, while to the east it is flanked by massive yew hedges and a fair rose garden. On the eastern side of the house, set upright against one of the numerous old walls of which there are several-and which are very necessary as a shelter from the wind-are two or three ancient Celtic inscribed stones, interesting evid- ence of occupation in pre-Norman days. A couple of decades ago these relics of old time had been allowed to suffer from neglect and one of them had actually been doing duty as a stepping stone across a ditch. Beyond the spacious and well-carei-for gar- dens are undulating fields, the groups of fine old trees in which mark the site of the former deerpark. Some Interests of the Interior. Let as leave this Arcadian environment and retrace our steps to the forecourt gateway, above which hangs a bell. A beam in this gateway bears date 1789. Passing along the stonepaved footway to the front door we note above the latter the Pelican which is the I*6. Car9f family. The entrance haU, with its low pitched roof, ceiling beams and oak panelling, at once strikes the key- note of the interior. Some alterations have taken place at Nash Manor within the last quarter of a century. What is now the western portion of the entrance hall was formerly the kitchen. The present drawing-room was, a century ago, the principle living room, and the former drawing-room, which is situate above the present one is now a bedroom. But of these and other alterations more anon. At the western end of the entrance hall which plan of the house is !represented by the cross of the letter H,\" is fireplace ov^r which is carved r?id Duwadigon,\" (God and enough). Old oak furniture, much of it carved, surrounds the entrance hall, and on the walls are one or two Pj^t-ings of St. Donets. fWT ri<Jorvr^J sp^h-westorn corner of the entrance hall leads to the new wing, a notable apartment in which is the dining-room, which has been exquisitely decorated in the Tudor style. The wall-panels have the lineh- pattern ornamentation, and the fireplace is finely carved. To the left of the latter stands a beautiful old oak cupboard which, to judge by its massive character and the restraint manifest in its decoration, dates from early Jacobean days. The Charm of the Drawing Room. The drawing-room, a large, oblong low- pitched apartment which opens out of the south-eastern corner of the entrance haU, and which is, of course, in the older wing, is the most interesting and charming room at Nash MAnor. Its appearance cannot have altered much within the past three centuries. The original massive ceiling beams remain. These beams extend both ways across the room, forming panels which are about 7ft by 8ft sqnare. The late 16th or early 17th century wall panelling remains in an excellent state of preservation. It is unfortunate that in the late 18th cen- tury the then owners of Nash saw fit to follow the debased tastes of that age by covering the old oak with a yellowish-drab colour. An interesting note concerning this is to be found in a manuscript book in the possession of the Nicholl family which contains an entry made early in the last century, to the effect that We have been to Nash to tea. They have painted^their dining-room a beautiful light oak colour In the greater portion of the room the paint remains to this day. The original Tudor stoue fireplace is a feature of the room, and the oak carving above this is especially noteworthy. Fluted pilasters with Ionic capitals rise on either side and there is a design of arcading with quaint figures. The beautiful light oak paint was re- moved from the wood around the fireplace by the late Mr Carne, and it is to be hoped that e'er long the present owner will take steps to restore the rest of this glorious old panelling to its pre-eighteenth century state. The Staircase and Library. One of the most picturesque corners of Nash Manor is the old oak staircase which, though small in size, is a beautiful piece of work, as may be seen by a reference to our illustration. There is a small landing at the top of the stair- case-a landing made especially picturesque by reason of the Tudor-headed doorways, one or two of which still retain their iron-studded doors, with ancient latches, which give access to the bedrooms. The library occupies the northern end of the west wing and this contains, among other interests, the original Tudor fireplace which had been for generations bricked up, and which was re-discovered by the late Mr Carne. This room, two or three decades ago, was utilised as a sort of store-room or outhouse, but since then it has been restored to the position which its anti- quarian interests deserve.

        "full_text":"1 By D. EMLYN EVANS. WELSH SINGERS AND THEIR CRITICS, A correspondent writes to us apropos the paucity of Welsh choirs at the Colwyn 11&1 National Eisteddfod and the charge of lack o' pluck brought against them by Press critics of English newspapers, and says: The results of the Gloucester Triennial FeS' tival carry a. lesson which is a rather sant practical demonstration of the fact t,bat the English people generally are not very aP' preciative of Elgar and his school. It is in sense an effective reply to the familiar sneers—of the musical correspondent of the Cottonopolis organ, and others of that coterie, over the alleged funk of Wclsb choirs on account of the difficulties of the piece In the chief choral competition.\"—It ,ill be remembered that the three contesting choirs were the Rhymney Gwcnt, North' Staffordshire, and Southport choirs. The critics were, however, somewhat too previoO3 —in too much of a hurry, for had they only waited till t.1e following day they would found that their strictures were out of pl¡¡.Ce, as the choral entries in the second competition —one of the test subjects there also being Elgar composition—consisted of three Welsh choirs (Bangor, Cefnmawr, and TrecywO) and one English (Crewe). As a matter of fact* Deep in my soul,\" the Elgar selection in the second choral competition, was a considerably more difficult test than his O wild west wind,\" in the chief choral. Fancy,\" says the editor of the School Music Reyiew,\" asking the second choral mixed-voice class to sing Elgar's inmy soul'—a virtuoso piece, of ext reme tonal difficulty The hoity\" toity mightiness of some of these critics is something amusing. They come among us-— an act of condescension on their part. no doubt —to teach us; and we are not above being taught, I hope. but to write in the vein of this mair will teach no one.\" The writer proceeds to explain why WeJsh choirs do not come for- ward in greater number at our national gather\" ings, and says,there were\" good reasons for it, but that' funk is certainly not one of them- It cost the Rhymney choir jE150 to come to Colwyn Bay, and that was the amount of the first prize offered there—had they succeeded in winning it. Under the most favourable circurn* stances they would have only had the bare honour. Eisteddfod Committees, our correspondent informs us—and he is an acknowledged expert on the question of eisteddfod engineering—can* not afford bigger prizes, and there are but places in Wales that can nowadays afford to get up National Eisteddfod choirs either- Soloists, quartettist s, etc., can go but to get a choir together is another matter— a reapon* sibility and an undertaking that cannot b6 lightly undertaken and brought to a successful issue. Of course, it would be but natural to ask here, where were the choirs of North Wales that were within near reach of Colwyn Bay, whose travelling expenses at least wo»J4 be but small ? The well-informed musica* reader will at once realise that at least twG North Wales resident conductors were other* wise engaged at the Eisteddfod—one as an ad\" judicator, and the other as conductor of tht Eisteddfod Choir—and if we eliminate tht\" two towns and districts represented by thcSØ gentlemen—Bangor and Carnarvon respectively —from that part of the country, what would remain, in the shape of material for the forma* tion of choirs of the first class, would be but limited both as to quality and quantity witb the exception of Wrexham possibly, and poPU\" lous places adjacent, such as Rhos, etc.; hub, Wrexham itseif has not, of late years at least* been prominently to the fore at the Eistedd\" fod, nor very active in musical work generallyo When circumstances are flourishing among thf quarrvmen of Bethesda, Llanberis, and FeS' tiniog none are more enthusiastic and devoted to musical work than they but even theit chief efforts at the National and other leading eisteddfodau, are confined as a rule to maltl voice combinations. What they may dõ in connection with mixed voice hoirS is to render supplementary assistance to tb4 ce ntral choral society in the chief town of tM district- Llanberis joining Carnarvon, Bethcsd\" ditto Bangor, and Rhos, <fcc., may do similarly with Wrexham, and so help- to establish choir that would be neither of small propo** tions nor mean ability.. This is more nee\" essary in North than South Wales on aecouO* of the comparative smallness of the towns and the sparse population. But there are other people than these nd admirari gentlemen, who know their Wales* its music, and its musicians far better than they, and who have given mach tboagbt to the question regarding the position of Welsh cboirS which has been exercising and, more or less, agitating the country of late years. The cauac of the defeat of Welsh choirs is not to be found in their alleged want of pluck, and inability to tackle difficult modern music- The particular rase in point, se- lected by their critics as shown effectually disposes of that charge, in that instance anyhow; and their past history bo that they have not lacked courage. Indeed. I were nearer the mark. possibly,to attribute toO much temerity to them, and not to count « cost and sufficiently prepare and equip themselves before hand—just about the faults as those committed by their Celtic fore- fathers centuries ago,though in a very different\" kind of tournament. The lesson has been taught to those humble enough to learn-tb sometime, and repeatedly, so that nothing W\"1 he gained by again beating thrashed The inhabitants of this little Wales of our* have been gifted with the best of natural vocal powers it is for them to develop and make use of them. To go and hide their talent in the earth will not do. No doubt present-day music makes excessive demandt upon the singers;J nevertheles what can b^ accomplished by one choir can be accomplished by another equally gifted and equally pains- taking. It may be as well to add here that the refer* ence of our correspondent to the GloucesW Festival at the commencement of his remarks* is in regard to the fact that, notwithstanding the onslaughts of the modern Ensrlish musicaj critic on the Messiah and Elijah,\" and that such musicians as Elgar, Hubert Parry' Harford Lloyd, Lee Williams, GranVille Ban* tock, Vaughan Williams, and Basil Harwood, were conducting their respective works at tbØ Festival; the oratorios of Handel and Me delssohn more than held their own, as testitieu by the increased congregation which came gether to those performances."},

Hugh Willyams, who was indicted jointly with his wife with having forged and uttered a promissory note for £2,000, purporting to have been signed by his uncle, Mr Brydges Willyams. Prisoner's wife, who on Saturday pleaded guilty to that and other similar indictments involving a sum. of over £5,()(X), came be- fore the Judge for sentence later in the day. She has been in prison awaiting, trial since the end of June, and is in adeJicatestate of health. Captain Willyams was then in Canada, but as soon as he learned that warrant was out for his arrest he returned to England and sur- rendered. The story of how the woman, alleging im- proper reJatiolko between herself and her uncle, imposed on her solicitor, Mr Charles Grylls, and persuaded him unwittingly to negotiate forged promissory notes, was told, on Saturday. The case agamst Captain Willyams rests on a document he signed, assuring She solicitor that with reference to the signature on the promis- sory note, he had seerf his uncle, who ac- knowledged his signature. Mr Justice Bankes is heard case, Mr Foote, K.C., prosecuting, Mr G. W. Elliot, K.C., defending, and Mr F. R. Y. Radcliffe, K.C., appearing for Mrs Willyams. Mr Elliot concluded his opening address for the defence in the morning, submitting that in signing the document declaring the signature to be his uncle's, Captain Willyams being in a weak state of health thought he was merely signing an expression of opinion that the signa- ture was genuine. Counsel incidentally stated that while the Captain was at the War in South Africa, Mrs Willyams acquired the morphia habit, and gave way to intoxication, besides having certain dealings independent of his knowledge. Captain Willyams, said counsel, had left to take up a situation as estate agent at Ontario on April 15th last, and the moment he heard of these proceedings he voluntarily returned to stand his trial. On surrendering to the police he made the following statement: Captain's Statement. I am absolutely innocent of this charge. I only knew that I was accused of it in July last when I was in Canada to get employ- ment, and everyone inew where I was going. I booked my passage out, and went in my own name. I wrote to my friends from thence, and I have come back at the earliest opportunity to meet it, As to the letter of 12th March, 1909, on which I understand the charge against me is formed I can only say I have no recollection of making any state- ment to the effect that I had just heard Mr Brydges Willyams acknowledge the signa- ture to the bill. The main idea in my mind was that I was asked to give my opinion as to the signature. I do remember making a statement that I believed the signature to the bill produced by Mr Grylls was the sig- nature of my uncle. Captain Willyams concluded counsel, had by no means lived on his wife since marriage, but had substantially contributed to the main- tenance of the home. Going out to the war as a trooper, he was given a. commission, rising to captain in 69th Imperial Yeomanry, and receiving £200 for his services. Captain's Denials. Captain Willyams afterwards gave evidence, stating that he was educated at Eton, and at the time of his marriage, in 1895, held a posi- tion in a local bank. From this he retired at his wife's request when he came into considerable property. His South African experiences in- cluded several attacks of enteric and his cap- ture by the Boers. His wife was also in South Africa during the war, and was taken ill, and he returned to England in 1902 on her account. Coming to March, 1909, witness said that before going to his residence at Tregorland, he had just undergone an operation for appendicitis in London. During March he was in a very weak state and suffering pain, and having to lie down the greater part of the day Until Mr Grylls arrived, on March 12th, witness knew nothing about a promissory note. He was greatly surprised to see Mr Grylls there. \"Mr Gwylls asked me,\" said witness, whether I thought the signature on the promissory note he produced was my uncle's. I had no hesi- tation in saying I thr>u<?bt it was. Mr Grylls asked whether it would be possible for him to see Mr Brydges Willyams, and I didn't think it would be the slightest bit of good his trying to. Mr Grylls said it was necessary to have the signature verified and my wife then said she wanted to speak t9 me. I went up- stairs and I asked her what this £2,000 was for. She said my uncle had made her a present of it. I said, what for She said she had some tradesmen's accounts to meet and would tell me no more about it, say-' ing that my uncle did not want me to know anythfrig about it. I felt extremely unwell a the time, and I sat down on the bed for some minutes, and afterwards we returned to Mr GryDs, my wife assuring \"me the. signa- ture was my uncle's. Mr Grylls, witness added, said a statement would be necessary to get the note negotiated, and to the best of witness's belief he signed a statement to the following effect\" I have seen the prom- misory note for £2,000 drawn by Mr Brydges Willyams, and payable to Mrs Hugh Willyams, and to the best of my belief the signature is that of my uncle, Mr Brydges WiHyams.\" Immediately afterwards witness went and lay down. In Wife's Handwriting. Subsequently he further questioned his wife about it, but she refused to say anything more. A number of letters to his father and uncle relating to promissory notes, and bearing his signature, witness declared to be forgeries. They were, he said, in the handwriting of his wife. He knew nothing of them until these proceedings were instituted. Letters of which he was ignorant, bearing his name, were also sent to Mr Grylls. Cross-examined, witness said he was, gener- ally speaking, ignorant of his wife's financial dealings. Mr Foote Do you know of any reason why Mr Brydges Willyams should have given you or your wife £2,000 ?—No, I do not. Witness swore that he never had the pro- misory note in his hand. He could notrecollect the sentence in the statement, I have just seen my uncle.\" Witness said he never dreamed there was anything improper in his uncle giving his wife £2.000. He thought his uncle had done it out of kindness. Witness answered further that he had a yacht and a motor car. Mr Elliott: What crew ?—Myself. (Laughter.) Re-examined, vtftness said he was always and was still fond of his wife. Several gentlemen having in the witness-box given Captain Willyams the highest character as an honourable and upright man incapable of doubtful conduct, the defence elbsed. Pending the jury's absence Mrs Willyams was brought into court, and Mr Foote, address- ing the Judge, said that of the notes forged for a total of three were utilised. Mr Radcliff, on the woman's behalf, said the story of her relations to Mr Brydges Willyams was absolutely without foundation. The woman was a slave of the morphia drug habit, her entire body being marked by scars caused by hypodermic injections. She had taken actually as much as fory-ftve to sixty-grains a ^he Judge, addressing Mrs Willyams, said she knew as well as he did what a wicked woman she had been, how callously indifferent to the reputation of others. He had heard what had been said about her being addicted to the morphia habit, but he was convinced she was in full possession of her faculties during the year of scheming which the crime covered. He would not* be doing his duty unless he sentenced her to three years' penal servitude. The woman, who was in a state of collapse, was practically carried out of court. The jury after ftve minutes' absence found Captain Willyams not guilty. The verdict was received with loud cheers."},

Griffiths, F.R.S.. at Holton- road Schools, Barry, on MondAy opened the new engineering laboratory established at the schools for tBe technical students of the evening classes at Barry, and afterwards in the Central Hall of the school delivered an address. Mr J. O. Davies (of the Barry Railway Company) occupied the, 'air. Principal Griffiths first of all expressed his satisfaction at the beginning thev had made in an engineering laboratory. Their teachers, however capable, could not, he said, make bricks without straw. They now had at Barry just what he should ask to have if he were starting a class of that description. He empha- sised the importance of technical instruction to the welfare of the nation, and said he was much more frightened of the German system of technical education than he was of German tironclads. He believed that if the latter be cAme more efficient than ours it would be be- cause of the German technical education. In Germany any man could get excused a certain time from the Army if he could produce the necessary education certificate, although it did not, he added, follow that it was worth having conscription to get this special pressure for improved education. In this country we sent young people into shops and works for six, seven, and eight hours a day, starting early in the morning, and expected them, after being tired to a certain extent, to devote their energies and leisure in the evenings to the fundamentals of technical instruction. \"I say,\" he added, it is not fair to our young people. (Hear, hear.) I always feel we are doing an injustice in expecting them to burn the candle at both ends. Of course it is rather the pick of them that will face it. However that may be, we do not want to injure the pick of them. I am convinced that there is a certain amount of injury being done, especially in the case of young women who come there by this burning the candle at both ends.\" (Cheers.) Both in Germany, he continued, and in the U.S.A. they were avoiding that verymn Nearly all the great engineering firms there gave their apprentices certain afternoons per week in order to attend the technical school, and paid them their wages for the time so spent. More than that they helped them in every way to take full advantage of the educa- tion. He was glad to see that there were a few employers in this country who were follow- ing this example. As a first step we ought to try and get for young people between the ages of 16 and 19 attendance at afternoon technical schools, reckoned as an equivalent to their work, what- ever it might be, the State, if necessary, bearing the expense. He wanted to get the employers to adopt this, and, if they were patriotic enough, to pay for it themselves. In Glamorgan they had very great reason to be proud of the extent to which technical education, in mining particularly, had ad- vanced. Glamorgan in that matter was ahead of the rest of the whole kingdom. But nevertheless Britain was not up to the countries he had mentioned. The employers seemed to expect students to come from technical schools knowing their business. Technical schools would never teach business, and if they tried to do it they would fail. The object arf the school was to instil scientific principles Vhich were to be applied in the workshop. What they wanted was a greater number of yoang men well trained in scientific principles. He believed difficulties would vanish when they made the people of this country believe in science. He was told Welsh genius was not for science but for literature. He was not one to limit the capacities of any Welshman."},

Crawshay Williams, M.P., Parlia- mentary secretary to Mr Lloyd George, speak- ing at a Liberal gathering at Leicester on Saturday night, said thee had been a ridicu- lous and disgraceful amount of misreprescnta- tion and exaggeration in connection with the land forms issued under the Land Tax clauses. He admitted the returns were not simple, and they might have been simpler but for the desire of the Government to protect the iust interests of landowners. No reform could be effected without trouble, and he feared thi objection I was not so mu h to the forms as to the land taxes themselves. But the landowners were fairly caught out this time.' If they made a high valuation they might be rated upon it, j and if the returns were on a low valuation and upon sale a higher value Was obtained the State would take it% share of the increment, j The best course was to make an honest return."},

        "full_text":"Testing a New Bridge. INTERESTING PROCEEDINGS AT CEFN. A remarkable and novel method of bridge- building may he seen at Cefn. near Merthyr, where the Merthyr Corporation, the Brecon County Council, and the Merthyr Traction Company are jointly constructing a bridge across the river Taff to take the pla-e-e of the old bridge, which not only has a dangerous turn in it, but is not strong enough to safely Carry the heavy motor traffic that is on the main roads. The new bridge is built of (he same material as the Pontypridd bridge, but the span is not so great. It is 105 feet, and is the second longest-spannc-d ferro-concrete bridge in the United Kingdom. The official test of the bridge was carried out on Tuesday by Mr R. G. Clark, A.M.I.C.E., of Cardiff, district engineer for Messrs S. G. Mouchall and Partners, civil engineers, West- minster, London, who represent the Henne- bique system in the United Kingdom. Among others present were Mr T. F. Harvey, borough engineer of Merthyr; Mr Best, Brecknockshire county surveyor; Mr Harpur, city engineer, Cardiff; Mr De Vesian. London and Mr E H. Page, Cardiff. Three heavy steam rollers and a tramcar, weighing altogether be- tween 48 and 50 tons, were driven on to the bridge, and the result of the test was eminently satisfactory. The Hennebique ferro- concrete is claimed to be more durable than either stone or steel, and it combines manyof the qualities of both, and may best be des- cribed as an elastic stone. This was demonstrated at the test by the small deflection under the rolling load. The maximum reading shown on the delicate in- Ptrumenta was one millimetre, being one < \"nLy.thousandth of the span. The test was of an elaborate and searching clmr jcter, amd the manner in which the bridge came oat of the ordeal speaks well for all con- cerned. Mr T. F. Harvey was responsible for the general design of the bridge, and that gen. 11onian was therecipient of congratulations from I bti engineers present at the luncheon which followed in the Gwynne's Arms, Cefn."},

        "full_text":"Disclosures at Bow-street discovery OF DEADLY POISON. Operation Scar as Clue. \"CRIPPEN A MODEL HUSBAND.\" Le Neve Jealous of Mrs Crippen. Dr. Crippen and Miss Le Neve were again i the dock at Bow-street, London, on Tuesday, the former charged with the murder of his £ ife, known in the theatrical world as Belle Elmore,\" and Le Neve with being an accessory after the fact. The details of the case were given by the prosecuting counsel, who dwelt particularly upon the finding of human remains in the bouse at Hilldrop-crescent, which Crippen and his wife had occupied, and-the discovery of a deadly poison in the organs that were un- earthed. He also gave Crippen's explanations °f his wife's absence to a number of people, and called a number of witnesses who knew the Crippens. The hearing was then adjourned Thursday, an application for bail made on °ehalx of Le Neve being refused. There seemed from the appearance of the Precincts of Bow-street in the early morning, to be a slight falling oil in the interest of the Public in the case nevertheless, there Was a large crowd present. People as they arrived were as before formed into a queue, which seemed com- posed mostly of country visitors and excur- sionists, among them being a white turbanned Indian and a bluejacket. Crippen was conveyed from Brixton Prison In the ordinary prison van. His arrival shortly after 9 o'clock was not noticed by the crowd. minutes later Miss Le Neve was driven to the front entrance in a four-wheeler, accom- panied by warders from Holloway. Not half a dozen people got a view of her. She carried a •mall parcel, which she held up to her face. There was no demonstration, and the people, except those in the queue, moved quickly away. Crippen is charged with the murder of Cora Crippen, and Le Neve That she, knowing the defendant, Hawley Harvey Crippen, to have done and committed the felony, did after- wards feloniously receive, comfort, harbour, •Od maintain him.\" The court was soon crowded, and among those accomodated at the rear were a number of American lawyers and Mr Victor Grayson, ex-member of Parlia- tnent. Mr Marsham, who took the first hearing, at- tended to acquaint his colleague, Sir Albert de ^fcntzen, with the facts of the ca^e, and to hand OVer the investigation to him. Sir Charles Mathews, Public Prosecutor, was present, and Inspector Dew was the centre-of interest on his arrival. Two American ladies tried to gain admit- ftance, saying that they represented a paper in (the United States, but, failing to produce their «ards, they were not allowed in. On the Bench besides the tnagjstrates were \"ir W. S. Gilbert and Sir Melville McNaghten, assistant commissioner Metropolitan Police. The female prisoner wore her dark blue cos- tnme and a heavy veil was drawn ovèr her Crippen was attired in grey frock suit. Be was without his glasses. Crippen's History. Mr-Trevers Humphrey, for the police prose- cation, then opened the case in detail, toying that many inaccurate statements tuMi appeared in certain sections of the Press. Crippen was charged with murder and Le Neve With being accessory after the fact. Tracing Crippen's history, counsel said he CBtce acted as manager of Munyon's Remedies [Company, and bis occupying similar positions f^bsewhere showed him to be a man with medi- cal knowledge. Le Neve had been his typist Wad confidential clerk since 1902, when he was tasanager of the Drouet Institute, down to the present time. Wherever Crippen had been em- Ployed, she was also engaged. Crippen and his \"Ïfe appeared to live on excellent terms. Mrs Crippen, who was 34, was, according to friends, *t *ery healthy woman, very cheerful and plea- sant, and extremely fond of dress and jewel- iIery, but Crippen had himself said that his \"ife was in the habit of giving way to violent 'outbursts of anger, and heha.d for some years Leased to live with her. Le Neve tteaious of Mrs Crippen. Oappen had said life was of no interest to gan and that his wife's anger was caused wttoagh her belief that he was fond of some father woman. It. would certainly seem she •J*ad good reason, for anger. Le Neve had been nOeippen's mistress for at least three years, and pvidenee would show that in J anuary last she expressing considerable, jealousy in re- feaed to Mrs Crippea. The last time Mrs Crippen was seen alive was on January 31st. On February 2nd Mrs Crippen should have been present -at a committee meeting of the Mrpiir Hall Ladies' Guild, but Miss Le Neve attended with two letters, cheque books, pass books and other documents. The ladies thought it strange that Mrs Crippen should bave gone without giving any information. A Week later Crippen explained to Mrs Mar- tanefcti that his wife had gone away and that she took only one basket. Suspicions were thenarocsed. Armoanstd His Wife's Death. Crippen and Le Neve were present at a ball **f the Music Hall Artistes' Benevolent Fund in February, when Le Neve wore a brooch recog- hiaed as belonging to Mrs-Crip pen. Answering inquiries, Crippen said his wife was Away on the mountains in the wilds of California. He Subsequentiy wrote that his wife was danger- tvusly ill with double pneumonia. A day or Wo after he told Mrs Martinetti that he had had a cable that his wife was very, very bad,\" -ad he expected a cable at any time saying 8he was dead. On the 26th March he an- nounced his wife's death in The Era news- Paper, and on April 6 he wrote to a friend, Dr. ■Burrows:—\" I am nearly out of my mind Mth poor Belle's death so far away.\" He fur- ther said his wife was in California on business tor him, and it was quite like her to keep up when she ought to have ben in bed. Be also intimated that he did not intend to keep on his house. As a matter of fact, said Counsel, notice to leave the house was actually Cven. In March Mr Nash, husband of a music kll artiste, returned from America and inter- viewed Crippen, and later the matter got into ^the hands of Scotland Yard. What Crippen Told Dew. Crippen, when seen by Inspector Dew, said i Well, I suppose I had better tell the truth. All my stories about j-, he.r illness and death are untrue. So far as I know she is not dead at all. Crippen also made a long statement, in which he said his wife went about with Mr Druce Miller, who sent letters to her with love and kisses. After that Crippen did not cohabit Vith her, and allowed her to do just as she • Jiked in the house, and go in and come £ >ut as she pleased. His wife said if she /feft him she would go right out of kis life, and he would never see her again. \"Crippen also described a quarrel which took ace after the supper at Hilldrop-crescent. His \"ife said she would leave him on the following day. When he came home he found her gone gd thought she had carried out her threat. i thereupon set about means for preventing -y scandal associated with her flight. Counsel said Mr Bruce Miller would be found if possible, and then added that Inspec- tor Dew told Crippen his wife would have to ',be found. The inspector drew up an adver- ,tisement leaving the address to be filled in by !Crippen, but Crippen took no further notice of v*lie matter. Before disappearing Crippen in- duced the lady manager of Munyon's business •to* cash him a cheque for £37. Crippen was 18eenno more until he W8B,arrested."},

He said he had been attending this institution now for 20 years, and this was the worst report he had ever pre- sented to them. There were 85 cases from their Union in the Asylum, which was a greater number than he had ever known, and besides there was an increasing number of children there. Mr Wheeler urged that the children should not be kept in the same institution as adults. The Chairman (Mr M. W. Colchester Wemyss) said there was not an institution in the country which provided exclusively for young people. Mr Penberthy, referring to the increasing number at children in the Asylum, said he thought there was no mor/ important matter which any Poor Law institution could discuss. As he was a new member of the board he wished to ask whether it was their practice to give outdoor relief to married epileptics. He contended that if they wanted to touch the germ of the disease they must do what they could to prevent the manufacture of lunatics. The Chairman assured Mr Penberthy the board did not give out-relief in such cases. = ("},

To-day, all are ready and willing to state their experiences with this wonderful remedy, and the following is a typical ^example of the esteem in which CONGREVE'S ELIXIR is held by thousands of one-time sufferers from the white scourge.\" The Rev. Ben Evans, of Barry, Cardiff, speaking of his recovery, said I was com- pelled to give up my ministry for three months. One doctor, who examined me is one of the leading physicians in South Wales; another is held in high repute. One of these said the apex of the right lung was affected. From the symptoms which I had, I believe he was correct. Under his care I put on a little flesh, but had relapse after relapse. This doctor ordered me to go to South Africa. As the relapses continued, I obtained Mr Congreve's book and placed myself in communication with him. I took the medicine according to instructions, and in time my lung healed so thoroughly, that when 1 was afterwards visited by another doctor, he doubted whether it had ever been affected. Another doctor confirmed this, and said he defied anyone to say there was anything the matter with my lungs. So complete was the cure that I have since been passed as a first-class life by the medical officers of two insurance companies. I have had no lung trouble since. I am positive Mr Con- gTeve's medicine cured me.\" CONGREVES BALSAMIC ELIXIR has been for nearly a century the standard household remedy for consumption, asthma, bronshiti- p leumonia, coughs, colds, influenza, and all ches:, and throat affections, and is ob. tainable from chemists rVf all parts of the worl(l, h,t' i n. 2/9,4/6 and 11/ 61, COOMBE 'JCJfcfclS GREAT 1a4118 I GOUT i ANP RHEUMATIC PILLS.

It was reported that the Post Office authorities at Cheltenham could not see their way to change the time of the mail from 8.40 to 8.30, and the matter was left in abeyance. Mr N. Moss moved that the Taff Vale Railway Co. be asked to run their workmen's trains to and from Merthyr instead of Pentrebach. This was agreed to. Th retir- ing President moved that Mr Henry Owen, vice-president, be elected to the chair for the ensuing year, and this was carried unani- # mously. Mr R. T. Jones was elected vice- president. The annual report stated that while, so far as actual results were concerned, there might not be much to show, yet there had been a considerable amount of continued attention given to matters which it was hoped might bear fruit. Regarding railway facilities the report stated that in the case of the Great Western Railway the Chamber was taking joint action with the Corporation, and was at the moment only waiting for a joint meeting. The Chamber was assured, however, that the matter would not be allowed to be shelved. If nothing came of the arrangements it would be the duty of the Council of the Chamber to take the matter up independently of any other body."},

Last June the Executive Council of the Amalgamated Society of Rail- way Servants decided that the action brought against the society by Mr W. V. Osborne brought him within the operation of the rule providing for the expulsion of members guilty of conduct prejudicial to the best interests of the society,\" and they accordingly recom- mended that he and his fellow members of the Walthamstow branch should be expelled from the society. This recommendation was unanimously adopted by the annual general meeting of the society, which opened at Barry On Monday, 3rd October. Mr Osborne has de- cided to test the legality of this action on the part of the society, and proceedings have been instituted in the Court of Chancery to restrain the society from putting into force the decree of expulsion. Mr Osborne's case is that a member who is instrumental in compelling his Union to desist from a practice that has been declared illegal by the High Courts can hardly be guilty of conduct prejudicial to the best interests of the society,\" and ought not therefore to be de- prived of his benefits, and prejudiced in ob- taining employment. It is believed that the case will be fought through all the courts up to the House of Lords as was done in the original Osborne ca8é. The Amalgamated Society of Railway Ser- vants has been particularly unfortunate in the amount of litigation in which it has been in- volved. The famous Taff Vale case, which led to the passage of the Trades Disputes Act of 1906, cost them about £38,000, whilst the recent Osborne case cost over £7,000."},

        "full_text":"NOTES BY A LONDON CORRESPONDENT. LONDON, Tuesday Night. News of the end of the Lefroy trial reached London at four o'clock this afternoon. It did not give rise to much excitement, and was, of course, unaccompanied by surprise. As compared with soma modern sensational trials, that of Lefroy has lacked the attraction of doubt or uncertainty as to its issue. In some of its predecessors there have always been two camps-one clinging to the theory of innocence, the other convinced of guilt. The wretched man who now lies under sentence of death has not even the consolation of knowing that here and there are some people who believe in his innocence. Even the in- genuity of a clever counsel has not been able for a moment to disturb this settled conviction. The best point Mr. Montagu Williams could make, related to the three hats, but this was a flimsy thing to set up against the strong rush of evidence of guilt, most of which Lefroy has sup- plied by bis own acts. There was no case, and the only marvel is that four days should have been required to complete the conviction. The names of nine new Assistant Commissioners under the Irish Land Act-are announced to-day. They will form three complete Sub-Commissions, each with its legal president and two laymen. At the Irish Office there is no disposition to share the dismay assumed in some quarters at the rush upon the courts. Day by day a good deal of work is being quietly disposed of. The new Sub- Commission will give valuable assistance, and the oases decided on are of a representative nature, which may be used to settle hundreds of others out of court. A private letter from Liverpool gives a curious and instructive illustration of the manner in which American speculation reacts upon English trade. The enormous speculations now going on in America in corn, cotton, and provisions, are having the temporary effect of withholding the export of these goods. This stopping ot the regular outflow makes freights so scarce and low that vessels chartered to go out from Liverpool to New York require exceptionally high rates in order to strike an aver- age. \"We are, for instance,\" says my correspon dent, \"now paying for scrap iron 18s. a ton by sailing vessel, whereas a few months ago the rate was 5s. Steam freights are even further propor- tionately increased.\" It is expected that some of the American rings will presently begin to loosen their hold, when trade may assume a healthier condition. We are on the eve of important and critical ex- periments with the electric light. It has been sufficiently proved, though it scarcely required demonstration, that it will not pay a householder to have the light substituted for gas by individual enterprise. The only hope for the electric light in this direction is that power should be generated from one centre, and be distributed much as gas now is. This is to be done forthwith, under the direction ot Mr. Edison. Premises have been taken near the Holborn Viaduct, where the necessary machinery will be erected, and the promoters will with judicious liberality, while the experiment lasts, supply the light free. Soma New York capitalists are at the back of the scheme, and have put down money to guarantee all possible cost. This will be a momentous and decisive experi- ment. and will be watched with much interest. The vacant canonry, with its stipend of ElOOO a year, is likely to be offered to Mr. Teignmouth Shore. Very few of our London clergy have managed so successfully to be constantly before the public. And this prominence has not been attained by eccentricities of theological ritual. About twenty years ago Mr. Shore, the son of a gaol chaplain in Dublin, came over and entered the service of the popular publishers of cheap works, Cassell and Petter. His ability soon brought him to the front, and I believe the more costly of their publications, the editions of Milton, Cervantes, and La Fontaine, illustrated by Gus- tave Dore, were prompted by his suggestion, and carried out under his management. For some time he was curate at Kensington, but there he obtained no great popularity. He certainly had not the credit of being either a powerful or an original preacher, but he had the good fortune to come in contaot with Royalty, and subsequently to obtain a chapel in an aristocratic district of town. His preaohing was appreciated by his con- gregation, and people who knew his social abili ties, his ready good nature, his ease of manner, his pleasantness, and his push, saw that he was destined te succeed in the race which he had selected. If he is offered the appointment, there is no doubt but that he will take it; and if he takes it, the Abbey will benefit by its new Canon. Connected with the proposed institution of an international Parcels Post, is the subject of inter- national money ordsrs. Mr. Fawcett has well recognised that one of the great facts of the last couple of years has been direct communication with the Continent. We shall almost have lost our character of insulars before the tunnel bp- tween Calais and Dover shall add England to the mainland. Every day we find ourselves more directly dealing with Parisian and Berlin shop- keepers, and if the Parcels Post gives us the ad- vantages which all other capitals have, Great Britain will become, for commercial pur- poses, not so much two densely peopled islands as a busy province of Europe. Now, the suggestion that has been made to the Postmaster- General is that he should arrange to give currency all over Europe to his excellent postal notes. From these admirable inventions the people seem to have a little held aloof, and what is wanted is encouragement and confidence. I think that they ought to be payable irrespective of date. The Government has got its money in advance, and it is protected from being liable to pay the money over more than once. Now what a convenience it would be if these little orders could be negotiable not merely in London, but in Rome, or Brussels, or Berne. What a facility for dealing directly with the foreign shopkeeper, or for making pay- ments to a local official. The question of discount could be settled as it is settled with existing Post Office orders. The advantage of the notes is that they are easily bought, and have a wide negotia- bility. It is clear that to extend that negotia- bility to foreign countries must be an integral part of the scheme of an international parcels post."},

The Duke, it is understood, was his Grace of Rich- mond. At a meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Liberal Association, at Birmingham on Tuesday, Mr. Harris, president of the Birmingham Liberal Association, was appointed chairman of the General Committee for the ensuing year. The associations at Glasgow, Kilmarnock, Bootle, and Taunton and Wolverton were admitted to the federation. The treasurer reported that the additions to the special fund amounted to £ 1000. It was decided to commence operations forthwith in the counties on the English land question. The next conference will be held on the 23rd inst, at Newcastle."},

Last week, Dr. Danford Thomas, the deputy coroner for Central Middlesex, held an inquest at the St. Pancras Coroner s Court concerning the death of Mary Ann Elridge, aged two years, the daughter of the man and woman residing in Compton street, St. Pancras, who were oharged with neglecting the deceased and other children, and were sentenced to six months' imprisonment each by Mr. Flowers at Bow street Police-court for such neglect last month,-Elil.abeth Creed, nurse, of St. Pancras Workhouse, said deceased (with three other children) was admitted into the workhouse on July 26th, and was then very ema- ciated. The ohild had convulsions, and witness did not think that it would live the night through. When deceased was weighed she was found to weigh 71lb. After a fortnight the deceased seemed to get worse, and it gradually took less and less food, and on Saturday last expired.—Dr. W. M. Dunlop, medical officer of the St. Panorae Work- house, said be made a post-tnortem examination, and he found that death resulted from gradual exhaustion from want of food and neglect. It had been so much neglected that nothing could save it. It was a wonder to him that it lived as long as it did. The other three children were also in a bad condition.-The jury returned a verdict of man-' slaughter against the mother and father, and when they come out of prison thev will be taken into custody on the coroner's warrant, and tried at the Old Bailey on the charge."},

At the Birkenhead Police Court, last week, John ana Catherine Barnes, man and wife, re- siding in Church road, Higher Tranmere, were charged with neglecting to provide sufficient nourishment to three children, of which they had charge, thereby endangering their lives. Two inspectors and a constable visited the house and stated that they wanted to see what children were there. Going upstairs the female pri- soner and the inspector went into a room, and the female came out instantly, carrying a child. There was not a vestige of furniture in the room, but near the fireplace was a little litter, such as would be made for a dog. The officers then went into the front room, and upon a mattress—there was no bed and no clothing—found two other little children. The male prisoner said he had bad one of the children two months, and the other two one month. They did not come to him to- gether. He did not know where they came from. He added, .a I am keeping them for a time; I will answer no other questions; I dont know where they came from.\" The children were wrapped in nothing but rags, and seemed badly cared for. The children found on the mattress were three or four months old; the other one was older. As soon as possible they were removed to the workhouse, where they were attended to by the nurses. The emaciation of the children had resulted probably from starvation. Since they had been at the workhouse and fed they had recovered. Both parties denied any neglect, and they were re- manded for a week. A number of letters relating to children from Manchester, Bristol, Rotherham, and other places were found in the house."},

        "full_text":"AN EXTRAORDINARY DUEL. The American papers just to hand Dublfch particulars of an extraordinary duel which occurred near Kansas City, on the 22nd August, between James Dobbins and Michael Burns, resulting in the death of both men. Burns and Dobbins were farmers and neighbours, and lived in the Kansas River bottom, six and a half miles from the city, and two miles above the south end of the county bridge that spans the Kansas River. Four years ago Dobbins got married, and at that time Burns lent him 80 dols. The money was never paid back by Dobbins, and on this account thpre was a feeling of enmity between the men. On Friday Burns came to town. DobbinS\"was at work on the read. On his way home Burns passed the place where Dobbins and others were working. The men did not have any conversation. To go to his house Dobbins had to pass by that of Burns. When Dobbins arrived in front of Burns's house, he found Burns standing before the door, revolver in hand. Burns said, \"'Jim, I want that money you owe n-ie. Dobbins made a reply which incensed Burns, but, disregarding his anger, Dobbins said, Throw down that revolver andl can whip you.\" Burns, threw the revolver on the ground by his side, when Dobbins said, \"«You have the-drop on m% now, but if you wait till I come back I will be heeled to meet you.\" Dobbins then drove his horses into his yard, and, leaving them unhitched, ran into the house. Hfre he got two revolvers and started towards Burns's place. Burns was sit- ting on the doorstop as Dobbins came up, and before he had time to move, and without a word of warning to Burns, Dobbins presented a revol- ver in each hand and opened fire. The balls from both revolvers lodged in the side of the hcuse. Burns then ran into the house, get his pistol, and rushed out upon Dobbins. The men advanced to within two feet of each other before a shot was fired b.v either. Dobbius fired first, the shot hitting Burns in the right foirearm. Burns returned the fire, and sent two bullets through Dobbin's chest. Although wounded des- perately, and fast becoming weak from loss of blood, Dobbins summoned ctrougth enough to lire again, his return shot tearing into Burna's abdo- men and passing through his body. Full ol rage, Burns managed to raise his revolver and discharge it once more. His last shot struck Dobbins under the left ear and passed clear through his head. Rushing together, the men clinched each other and fell to the ground, Dobbins being underneath. Burns then beat Dobbins over the head and face with'the butt end of his revolver. Supposing IhW Dobbins was dead, Burns was about to leave him, but with a desperate effort Dobbins turned and in a moment had again thrown Burns to the ground. One of the neighbours, a Mrr. Kalfton, appeared at this time and pulled Dob- bins away from Burns. Two young men coming up, the men were separated. Burns was then carried by the men to his own house, and they went back to the scene of the fight to carry Dobbins away. Lifting the man to his feet they walked on each side of him, supporting him between them. They had hardly gone the yards before Dobbins sank down 'on his Imees and died in the woods. He died without saving 31 word. Burns lingered for two days, when he died. Burns was an unmarried man. Dobbins leaves-a widow and child."},

At the Marylebone Police Court on Tuesday, a young woman applied for advice and assistance, she having, as she alleged, paid lis. for pills to a man named Stafford, who advertised to make short people tall. These were the directions given to the young lady:—\"As a preliminary necessity, the skin must be kept perfectly clean, and the pores opened by frequent rubbing with a dry rough towel. Avoid as much as possible carrying heavy weights on the head or shoulders. Abstain from smoking and spirit drinking, and indulge to the least possible extent. A short rest at table is ad- visable after a hearty meal. An effort should always be made to breathe through the nose and not through the mouth, both in the sleeping and waking condition. In walking, the body should be held erect, the chest thrown forward, and the shoulders kept well back.\" The applicant, finding she grew no taller by observing these directions, considered that she had been swindled."},

UoMr:;AY, Esq., and Captain PEARSON.] BEERHOUSE INFORMATION.—Henry Harding, land- lord of the Black Horse, Ble witt-street, was sum- moned for opening his house for the sale of beer during prohibited hour's on the Sunday previous.—P. S. Mc Evoy went to the house at a quarter to tive on the Sunday afternoon, and found two inen and a woman there drinking beer. The landlord said they were travellers, but he knew two of them as residents in the neighbourhood the other was a traveller. --This was not the first offence, and the Magistrates inflicted a fine of 20s. and costs, which were paid by defen- dant's wife, who had answered to the summons RIDING ON A FOOTPATH.—Matthew M. Cope, of Caerleon, was summoned, at the instance of the High- way Trustees, for riding along the footpath, on the high road to Caerleon, on the 6th of June.—Thomas Hopkins proved the offence, which was admitted by defendant.-The latter said he got on to the footpath to avoid the water and the mud. The roads were in a dreadful state, and it was raining hard at the time. The Clerk (Mr. H. J. Davis) said, at the last meeting of the Trustees a complaint was made against the Sur- veyor, and a report was made against some one for riding on the footpath, whereupon the Trustees ordered the offender to be summoned. Defendant believed it was because he had signed the memorial protesting against the bid state of the roads that this summons was taken out. He paid X20 a year towards the high- way maintenance, and he thought for that he had a right to expect a good road.—Mr. Homfray Quite so and a good path as well.-The Ciet-k How do you pay £ 20?—Defendant I pay as much as that for turn- pikes.—Mr. Homfray So did other people. For an offence of this kind there was a penalty of 40s. This was no personal matter, and the case was not serious, so he thought it would be met by payment of the costs. AssAULT.Joseph Roberts was summoned for assaulting Charles Lewis, and there was a cross-sum- jnons.—After evidence had been given, Mr. Cathcart, for defendant, admitted the assault, and withdrew the cross-summons.—The Magistrates considered that a very serious assault had been committed, and fined defendant 20s. and the costs. A PESTILENT HOVEL.—John Criuder, an eccen- tric old man, was summoned for causing a nuisance at I Christchurch, by living in an overcrowded and filthy dwelling.— Mr. W. D. Evans, Clerk to the Board of Guardians, appeared to prosecute.—The service of the summons had to tie proved, because the wife, and not ) the defendant, at first answered to it. Mr. Evans said this was a case in which defendant, his wife, and three children two daughters and a son, all adults and a child of one of the daughters, were living to- gether in one small room, 12it by 8ft and wherein they occasion dly had another daughter to stay with them. The tenement was situated in the village of Caerleon and the parish of Christchurch. The place was in a filthy condition there were no offices or other convenience there was a case of small-pox in the room, and one of the daughters was in a sickly condition.—Mr. J A. Morris, surgeon, of Caerleon, corroborated these facts. There were two tenements under one roof, and both equally untit for human habi- tation. There were three cases of small-pox under the same roof.—Mr. Evans said the case was laid under the 21st section of the Sanitary Act of 1S6(3 Mr. Homfray asked if notice had been served on the defendant fo abate the nuisance. -Mr. French, the Inspector, sa;(i a notice was served, but he could not prove the service. It was admitted by the wife.—Mr. Evans asked for an or 'er for the removal of the people. —Mr Hotufray: Where were they to go? -Mr. Evans did not know. He wanted the people out, in order to have the place clean.se I and disinfected.—Mr. Homfray No doubt it was very necessary, but where were they to go when turned out.—Mr. Evans said the Act gave the Magistrates power to make the order. —Mr. Homfray said he should not like to sign such an order. He thought it was for the nuisance autho- rity to interfere.— Mr. Evans assured the Bench that they had the power, and that the order must come from them. Defendant, who now appeared, violently denounced Mr. Watkins and the doctor as having in- stituted these proceedings through spite, because one of his daughters had had an lllegtimate child. The case was adjourned for a week, and defendant advised meanwhile to abate the nuisance. BOROUGH POLICE.— MONDAY. [Magistrates: The Mayor (D. ITAPRRY, Esq.), and W. EVANS, Esq.] FLOWER STEALERS BEWARE.—William Gogan and William Curry were charged with stealing growing roses the property of Jame3 Pask, from his garden on the Maindee-road.—Police-constable Turner saw the defendants early on Sunday morning, coming from a garden with a bunch of ros-s, and he took them into custody. He had examined the gardens on the Maindee-road, but could not find any one where roses of the kind produced were grown. Complainant's garden had been robbed, and he said those produced were similar to the roses stolen. Defendants admitted the offence, and said they had been at a wake\" on Saturday night, and early on Sunday morning they turned out and committed the robbery in question.— It was stated that offenders are liable to a fine of X20 or six months' imprisonment for a first offence of this kind.—Fined 10s. 6d. each, or 14 days' hard labour. A YOUNG THIEF.—Margaret Brian, aged 12 years, was charged with stealing a writing-desk, the property of Jesse Turner, of Clytha-park-road.—On Satur- day afternoon the prisoner showed a lot of papers to a girl named Hopkins, and said she had found them in an empty house belonging to Mrs. Carpenter. -To another girl she showed a photograph, which she said she had found in the same house. Sergeant Curtis found the writing-desk in the void house, and on goius to Brian's house he saw the father, who had one of the articles missed from the desk in his pocket. Apprehended the girl near the market, and when he charged her she denied having stolen the desk.— Prosecutor said the desk was missed on Saturday afternoon. It was stolen from a table which stood near an open window. -Prisoner was further charged with stealing a child's tunic.- L,einanded on both cases till Wednesday.. ASSAULTS. Charles Hill was charged with assaulting John White.—Both men are masons at work in the Mon- mouthshire yard. On Friday last they had some words about their boys fighting, and complainant said he did not wish his boy to tight. Defendant said he would fight him, and on complainant declining the challenge, defendant replied that he would make him, and his brother said to him, Give him a warm un.\" Defendant then struck complainant a severe blow be- tween the eyes, and caused blood to flow freely. The defence was that complainant was the aggressor, and a witness was called, but he said that he did not see the beginning of the affray.—Fined 21s., or a month's impiisonmeut. Joseph James, butcher, St. Mary-street, was charged with assaulting Prudence Coomer, a married woman.—A few days ago the defendant was striking his wife, and complainant, a lodger, went to him, when he struck her a blow on the arm.—Defendant's wife said her husband pushed her, and she fell, and she was on the floor when complainant came into the room. The disturbance between them arose out of the wife's neglect in respect to her husband's dinner. —Dismissed. Julia Hayes wis summoned for assaulting Johanna Leonard.—The assault complained of was committed on Thursday last, and complainant, with her son \"Mike,\" were the witnesses in support of the charge. .Bound over to keep the peace towards each other, and the costs to be divided between them. WINDOW SMASHING.—lohn Connor was summoned for breaking ten panes of. glass, the property of William James. -Defendant said he broke them be- cause he could not get a summons against a woman who broke his window.—Ordered to pay 9s. 8d. damage, Is. fine, and costs. A 5irAKR0W ESCAPE.—.John Lawton was charged with being in the Steam Packet Inn, on Saturday niO'ht. with intent to commit a felony.- Between nine and ten o'clock the landlord saw the defendant walk upstairs and on following him he said he was going to bed, and that he had paid the landlady.—This was not true. —Defendant said he was very sorry, and was now discharged with a caution. DLUNK ASD DISORDERLY. Henry Thomas, an elderly man, was charged with being drunk and incapable, and lined os. Catherine Pring, for a similar offence, was fined 5s. John Gibson, drunk and disorderly, was fined 5s Ann Williams, drunk and disorderly on Sunday night, was fined 5s. Cornelius Kelly, an imbecile, who was founc runk, was sent to the lunatic asylum, as his parents were unable to take care of him. WEDNESDAY. [Magistrates The Mayor (D. HARRHY, Esq.) and T, BEYNON, Esq.] STEALING A WRITING DESK.—Margaret Brian, a little girl 12 years of age, was charged on remand with stealing a writing desk, the property of Jesse Turner, from his residence, No. o, Clytha Park-road, on Saturday last--The writing desk was last seen safe on a table near the window facing the street, and was missed on Saturday evening. Supt. Huxtable lives immediately opposite, and during the afternoon his servant girl saw the prisoner clambering up to look in at the window. She was afterwards seen coming from a void house with papers and a carte in her hand, and. aD investigation led to the discovery of the writing desk in this void house. Detective Curtis apprehended the prisoner, and afterwards searched her father's house, wherein he found a quantity of papers that had been taken from the desk, and the father handed over a looking-glass which he had in his pocket. Prisoner was further charged with stealing a purse containing •Is. from a little girl in Mr. Evans's shop, on Saturday last. The little girl, named Mary Ann Pearce, was sent to Mr. Evans's shop to buy groceries, and whilst there she lost the purse. It was afterwards traced to the possession of the prisoner, who stated that she had picked the purse up in the shop.—Supt. Huxtable said this child was one of the cleverest young thieves in Newport. She had been several times in the hands of the police, and once convicted.—For stealing the purse, which the magistrates held to have been clearly proved, she was sentenced to 28 days' imprisonment, and tive years' in a Reformatory. When removed prisoner commenced shrieking at the top of her voice, abused the witnesses violently, and kicked the officer who removed her in a most violent and vicious manner, misbehaving herself to such an extent that she had to be manacled. ASSAULTING A POLICE CONSTABLE. — John Nash and Charles Powell, labourers, were charged on a warrant with assaulting P.C. Wallace in the execution of his duty at Pill, on Saturday morning. P.C. Wallace found Nash sleeping on a trolley, on one of the wharves, between twelve and one o'clock on Satur- day morning. Roused him, and when he had managed to get on to his legs he asked the constable who he was and what he wanted, at the same time knocking him ver with a violent blow under the ear. The constable recovered himself and made use of his Staff, when the other man came up and rescued .Nash.- Roth defendants received a good character, and it was said they had business on these wharves, and were going to work at loading a vessel an hour or two after the policeman left them. Discharged, QUARRELSOME CABMEN.—William Perrett, a cab- mau in the employ of Mr. Plummer, of Pill, was summoned for assaulting Henry Simmonds, on Tues- day last.—It appeared that on Monday evening the men fell in each other's way, and caused some hin- drance to their progress. On Tuesday the feud was continued when they met again in the street. De- fendaut said he should have a summons against the complainant for blocking the thoroughfare on the previous night. Complainant jumped off his cab and asked defendant what that was for defendant told him for blocking up the thoroughfare, and followed up his explanation by striking complainant three violent blows in the face. Complainant had no corroborative testimony, and for the defence it was shown that the violence was only made use of in self-defence.- After hearing the whole case the Mayor said the magistrates were of opinion that complainant had brought? this upon himself, and they should therefore dismiss the case, and order him to pay the tosts. The Mayor added that he happened to hear the abusive and disgraceful language made use of by com- pi linaut, and he had a very good mind to summon him for that offence also. THE STONE THROWING NUISANCE.—John Sanders and Thomas Marsden, boys, were charged with throw- ing stones at the house of John Parker, on Sunday.— Prosecutor had reason to complain of the boys' conduct on Sunday afternoon, and they at once commenced abusing him and threatened to throw stones at his door. As soon as his back was turned a great stone struck the door.—The Clerk said this stone throwing was becoming a very great nuisance.—The Mayor said boys ought to know they were liable to a fine of 40s. In this case defendants would each be fined 2s. 6d. and costs, or in default seven days' hard labour. WIFE BEATING.—Joseph Holford was summoned for assaulting and beating his wife —Defendant did not appear, and his wife refused to be sworn to give evidence against him because she said she had given him provocation. Case dismissed. VIOLENT ASSAULT WITH A TEAPOT. Margaret Murphy, wife of the man convicted of window smash- ing, was charged with a violent assault on a young girl named Eliza Barry, by striking her on the head with a tin teapot on Sunday evening.—The girl's head was severely wounded, and the teapot considerably damaged.—The assault was not denied, and defendant was fined 10s. Gd., or 14 days' hard labour. TROUBLESOME Boys. Patrick Neal and James Manship, small boys, were summoned for throwing stones, and for extinguishing a lamp at PilL-Neal climbed up the lamp about 9.30 and put the gas out, and now admitted that he did so.—The Mayor said bovs of his age ought to have been in bed at that time of night. They were discharged with a caution. DRUNK AND DISORDERLY. Blanche Harrhy, an old woman, receiving 2s. per week from the parish, was charged with being drunk and disorderly in Charles-street at midnight. She said she Had been out to work, and had some whiskey given to her.—Advised not to drink whiskey again, and discharged with a caution. Ann Lewis Was charged with creating a disturbance in the Castle precincts at eight o'clock on Tuesday evening. She said she had been struck on trie head a violent0 blow, which drew blood, by a young man named Roberts, and that was the reason she made the distn rba,nce,-She was discharged, and the magistrates advised her to take out a summons against Roberts for the assault. David Coghlan and John Coghlan were summoned 1 Z7 for being drunk and disorderly in the streets. David did not appear. John was convicted, and fined 5s."},

        "full_text":"FARMERS7 COLUMN. FALL IN JRENTS.—From many quarters come reports of fall in rents where the fanning has been principally arable. In the north let at £ 900, re-let at £ 700; 500 acres, let at £ 450, re-let at £;)00. In the midlands still greater re- ductions have been made-farms let at JE650, £ 750, and £780, now re-let at £JOO, JC150, and £ 120. But the greatest reductions appear to have been made i. the south and west, where the holdings are smaller and the farming with less capital, as much as 50 percent, has been taken in reduction, while in many instances landlords have taken over the land for pasture, or in a few cases for game preser 7es. But there is no doubt that the scare is only a. temporary one, and if farmers would leave farming alone until they had proper capital to work with, so that they might employ good implements, manure, andfcod for the beasts, we should hear less of the failures. SCARCITY OF POINTERS.—There is a great scarcitv of well-broken pointers and setters. One of the largest buyers in England tells me he has expe- rienced the greatest difficulty in securing anything good; and, although late in the season, is still on the look-out. It is to be feared that too much attention is being bestowed upon dogs of good 87/mmetry, suitable lor the show bench, and that the more valued properties of the breed are being neglected. Breeders should not forget that as, in human beings, children from educated parents are mor^ easily taught, so it is with animals, and that, in order to keep up the intellectual qualities of sporting dogs, it is necessary to breed from those that have been proved to be good in the field. It is satisfactory to see the demand on the increase, as shooting over a. good dog is far more sportsmanlike and enjoyable than the present style of walking xip or driving birds.—Lice Stock Jourral. POULTRY.—Chickens will never thrive if over- crowded, and what may be enough room one month will not be the next, because of their con- staut growing, so that it is imperatively necessary to kill off the surplus birds. If the object of keep- ing the fowls be simply for domestic purposes, then all the cockerels save one or two may be dis- posed of, and also those hens or pullets which it is not necessary to retain, remembering to keep only as many as the houses and runs can easily accommodate. At the same time the selection is made have au eye to next year's breeding pens, and keep birds likely to be useful then. If exhibiting is intended, it will ba necessary to retain more cockerels in order to send pairs to shows, and if these have never run with the hens they will live peaceably, but if they have, it will be requisite to keep each male bird separate, which can be done in caged or in very large coops with runs, it being batter for the birds themselves to be kept from the hens. Oi course, surrounding circumstances must decide individual cases. Changeable weather may now be looked for, and it is necessary to see that the birds are well housed at nights. Extra attention also is needed with the food, and a roally hot crowdy first thing in the morning will be very acceptable to the birds. We say really hot, because many use warm or luke- warm water, whereas it ought always to be boil- ing. If the weather be very cold or wet, put a little stimulating powder in the meal before it is mixed. Give buckwheat, barley, and ladian corn as hard food. CHKESE-MAKING IN DERUYSHIEE.—The lollowing description of the manufacture of Derby caeeso is from Mr. George Gibbons' interesting report in the new number of the r oyal Agricultural Society's Jourllal:- The process of cheese making varies with the different reasons of the year; doubtless the one in operation during the summer is the most valuable, and I will now give it as seen on the\" Kothill\" farm of the late Mr. W. T. Carrington, wbert Derbyshire cheese has been made for many years. This farm is very inconveniently situated, its approach being through fields that in wet winter months must be nearly impassable. The soil is mostly heavy and of an inferior descrip- tion, and, although drained, yet the past wet seasons have much injured it. The capital dairy cf some forty shorthorns showed at once that they were indebted to other than home resources for their fine condition and large yield of milk. Mr. Carrington s practice of feeding them daily with 3 to lib. of decorticated cotton cake has been attended with the best results to the cattle, besides adding much to the utility of the farm. \"Bamford'n cheese-making machine\" is used in this dairy, and proves a source of con- siderable economy both in time and labour. The milk made up at the July inspection consisted of about 100 gallons, the produce of the morning's and evening's milkings. When heated to 84 degrees the rennet is a.dded, and the mass stirred some time, it being most essential to tliorovgbly mix it with the milk. One hour is allowed for coagulation when the breaking up of the curd conmences. This is done by a.n implement in the shape of a sieve, with wires placed crossways over the bottom of it. The greatest care is taken in this most important operatiom, the weight of the breaker being almost sufficient to sink it to the bottom of the tub, whence it is raised by a. handle fastened perpendicularly on its centre. After the whole matter has thus been treated the breaking goes on more rapidly; the ohject aimed at is to keep the whey as green as possible. At the expiration of about forty-five minutes, when the curd is broken into pieces about the size of peas, itris allowed to settle a short time, tnd is then gathered by a small shovel into the centre of the tub. The whey, then quite clear, is let off by a tap placed in the side of the tub, about one-third from the top. A stout, well-protected tin-plated follower, thickly perforated with holes about the size of common shot, and made to fit the in- terior of the tub, is now placed in it, and sinks by its own weight on the curd the whey runs off by another tap fixed on the bottom of the tub. The follower or sinker, which can bo easily raised or lowered by means of a most convenient apparatus, connected with the machine mentioned above, is then lifted, the curd cut with a knife about a foot from the sides of the tub, and agaim collected in the centre (the whey constantly running off and the sinker lowered, on which considerable pressure is applied by a screw, forming also a part of the machine. This operation is repeated continuously eight or ten times, until the card is fairly dry, necessarily occupying considerable time and almost incessant attention. The curd is then ground in a mill, also made by Bamford, through which it passes twice; fine cheese-salt is mixed with the curd in the proportion of loz. to Glb.; and 401b. are made into one cheese. After being in the press for an hcur, it is taken from the vat and placed in hot water at 150 degs., for a minute; this is termed \"scalding.\" It is again placed in the vat and pressed for five minutes, then taken out and a dry cloth put on, again pressed, and allowed to remain without further disturbance for four hours, when it is taken from the vat and about lib. of salt rubbed into it by the hand over all the exterior. This salting is repeated during the next three days, when the cheese is taken from the press, washed in warm water, and placed in a room heated to 70 degs. by means of three open pipes passing from an outer room through the kitchen fire into the cheese room above. Thus a very economical heat is obtained, the only objection being its sulphurous smell. After 20 days the cheeses are placed in a cooler room, and at three months old are considered fit for sale. The operations thus described entail a great amount of laborious work, and by .the time thev are concluded rest must be welcomed. The wife of Mr. Carrington's trusted foreman on this farm, Mrs. Stevenson, has made the cheese for several years, and with the aid of only one person takes the charge of her house and family, and does the entire work of the dairy, and without the help of conveniences and labour- saving appliances, found in many dairies, she makes a fine class of cheese, commanding uni- formly high prices; and in the cheese-room can be seen a collection of certificates and awards of prizes given by the Derbyshire, Staffordshire, Liverpool and Manchester, and other societies, besides two, value £30, awarded at the Kilburn exhibition of the Royal. The next process to be described, differing somewhat from Mr. Car- rington's, is that seen in operation in July for Derbvshire cheese-making at Mr. Milner's, Alfreton. The dairy management on this farm affords a curious illustration of divergence of opinion amongst practical men as to the rela- tive advantages of milk selling v. cheese making. The farm house, situated on a gentle slope some quarter of a mile from the railway station, is very small, and the dairy-room by far the worst of that of any of the competitors. It is most inefficient in its requirements as such, and it has also to serve as the larder and pantry for the family, Yet, with all these disadvantages, and the great facility for cheap delivery of milk to the station (as a hand cart would most easily do it, thus dis- pensing with a horse), still Mr. Milner continues to make cheese, and would not take less than 8d. per gallon for his milk, even during the summer months, knowing that he can make fully tha.t price of it in cheese."},

They also desired that a licence should not be withdrawn on the occasion of the death of the holder, which might deprive the residue of the family of their means of livelihood, when the widow, or children might be able to continue the business. The Home Secretary replied that he would con- sider the subject wi'h the Lord Advocate of Scot- land, and expressed himself favourably in reference to the views of the deputation."},

These reports were adopted. Inspector Sheppard, Monmouthshire County Con- stabulary, attended before the Board in answer to a request, to render an explanation in reference to the removal of his son to the Abergavenny asylum.

J. Lloyd, and T. P. Wansbrough. WATCH COMMITTEE. The minutes were read and confirmed, and Supt. Huxtable presented his fortnightly report and returns of convictions, &c. He also reported a case of \"in- subordination on the part of P C. Morgan, 34, the constable who was reduced a few weeks back for neglect of duty. It appeared that on Friday night he was getting his tea in the police office with Constables Williams and Brooks, and some banter passed between them. Morgan lost his temper and threatened to flatten Williams's nose. Supt. Huxtable said Morgan had unsettled the force a good deal, and given con- siderable trouble. After the matter had been considered Morgan was called in, and recommendec to resign. LOCAL TAXATION. le The Town Clerk read a communication from the Local Taxation Municipal Association, asking the co-operation of the Town Council, with a view to .egislation. The Council were divided in opinion as to the necessity for discussing the question at this meeting, and eventually it was decided to procure copies of the letter and report of the meeting which took place at the Westminster Palace Hotel relative to this subject, and circulate them amongst the members of the Council. They would then have an opportunity of forming an opinion upon the important questions which they were asked to consider, and be prepared to give an opinion at a special meeting of the Council, to be called for that purpose. BRICK MAKING ON THE MARSHBS. An application for a piece of land on the Marshes, whereon to make two or three million bricks, to be used on the ground, was referred to the Works Committee. BOARD OF HEALTH. The minutes were read and contirmed. Mr. G. W. Jones called attention to the disgraceful state of Park-square. Mr. Lewis complained of the dangerous condition of Bolt-street, and other thoroughfares in that neigh- bourhood. Mr. Lloyd thought it would be better to carry out the projected improvement to the roads in Baneswell before commencing any fresh work. The Mayor said the necessary notices in that case would be served directly. Mr. Lewis did not see why notices in the other cases could not be served simultaneously. This matter was also referred to the Works Com- mittee. It was stated that Dixon, the man at the weighing machine, would resign his post at the end of the month also that eight applications had been made for the appointment. On the motion of Alderman Homfray, seconded by Mr. Murphy, it was decided to refer the applications to a Committee of Selection, and proceed to the ap- pointment at the next fortnightly meeting. An objection was at first raised to the adoption of this course by Mr. Lewis, who wished that all the applications should come before the Council, because he had heard it stated outside that a selection bad already been made. This, however, was withdrawn when he was assured that he had been misinformed, and that all the applications would be laid before the Council, but with a recommendation from the com- mittee as to which were the most eligible. STREET TRAMWAYS. Mr. Murphy again brought forward the question as to the desirability of sanctioning the introduction of tramroads through the main thoroughfares of New- port. He begged to say he was of opinion that this Board ought to put itself in order by granting facilities for tha introduction of an improved means of transit in the town, as was now being done, not only in Cardiff and neighbouring places, but almost in every part of the world. He had observed in, the papers advertisements from India, Germany, France and other countries, for tramroad materials. He believed they were being laid down successfully, and that where laid they were being worked with the greatest advantage, especially to the working classes. Now that they had active and close competition all around them it was essential that they should give the work- ing classes the greatest facility possible for pursuing their avocations, and he believed the introduction of tram roads would be one of the greatest improvements that had ever taken place in the borough. Men who now had to foot it long distances to their work would be greatly benefited, and there would be a corres- ponding advantage to the employers, because the men would be more fit for their labour. It would save the towu a considerable sum out of the rates, because two- thirds of the whole cost of maintaining the roads would be removed from the shoulders of the Corporation, and as the maintenance of roads was one of the heaviest burdens they had to bear, it was the duty of the Cor- poration, if they could do so, to reduce these rates by the introduction of tramroads. He would therefore give notice that at the special meeting of the Council to be called for the purpose of considering the subject of local taxation he should bring forwad the whole question of the construction of tramroads in the borough. Mr. Bolt said it would be necessary to fix the rate of speed, because the Union would not allow workmen to go more than three miles an hour. (Laughter.) Mr. Lewis asked what was the result of the discus- sion on this question twelvemonths ago The Town Clerk said the Council were of opinion that the time had not arrived for entertaining it. The Surveyor said the order from the Local Govern ment Board could not be obtained by the applicants without the sanction of this Board, and it was thought the time had not come for tramroads in Newport. WORKS' COMMITTEE'S REPORT, \"At a meeting of the Works Committee, held at the Council House, on Tuesday, the 11th day of June, 1872- Present: David Harrhy, Esq., Mayor, in the chair; Aldermen Homfray and Townsend, and Mr. L. A. Horn- fray. The Surveyor's attention was directed to the situation of the lamp near the Old Toll-house, Stow-hill and he was requested to place the same on a lamp post inside the Waterworks premises, with bracket over roadway, as first suggested by the committee. The Surveyor informed the Committee that Dixon the weigher at the Corporation Machine, had given notice to resign on the first of July. Several applications were laid before the meeting. The Committee recommend the Board of Health to take measures for filling up the vacancy. The Building plan sent in by Messrs. Habershon, for enlarging a house in Park-square, was recommended for approval. The Plan sent in by Mr. Jonah Francis, for a house in Clytha-square, was recommended for approval. The state of the pavement in High-street was consi- dered, and the Surveyor was instructed to confer with the owners on the east side, trom Skinner-street to Griffin- street, to ascertain if they will contribute to the expense of newly laying down the same. \"As the scavenging contract will expire on the 1st of August, the Committee recommend the Local Board to advertise for tenders on the present system of the Board employing their own labourers for sweeping and scraping, and contracting for hauling the same away and that the new contract shall extend to carrying away the ashes and refuse at Pillgwenlly, including Baldwin street, and below the Well at Pill, together with scrapings, &c., from the bridge over the river Usk, which the Corporation now scavenge by agreement with the County Jusiices. The Surveyor was instructed to procure from London two of the new reflector street lamps to try the effect thereof.\" It was resolved on the motion of Mr. Stone, se- conded by Mr. Lloyd, that the recommendation of the Committee, as to the cleansing of the streets, should be contirmed. On the suggestion of Mr. Murphy, it was decided to make the agreement subject to revision in the event of tramroads being introduced, because the arrange- ment was to hold good for three years. THE THOMAS-STREET IMPROVEMENTS. Mr. Lloyd called attention to the fact that a Special Council Meeting, summoned to consider the Great Western Railway Bill, now before Parliament, had been countermanded, and he asked for some explana- tion. The Mayor said there was a slight hitch in the arrangements between the Corporation and the Com- pany, but it had all been satisfactorily settled, the Company having approved of the draft agreement, as amended by the Corporation. MARRIAGE WITH A DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER. Mr. Lewis said he had received a communication respecting a Bill now before the House of Lords, for legalising marriage with a deceased wife's sister, and he had been asked to bring the matter under the notice of the Council. He had received no notice as to whether or not an application had been received by this Corporation, asking them to support the Bill, but such communications had been received by several gentlemen in the town, and, he believed, all the Corporations in England had replied favourably to it, with one exception, and in that case the motion to petition was lost by one vote only. The Town Clerk said such a communication had been received, but it was not thought necessary to take any notice of it, and he did not know where to lay hands on it. Subsequently Alderman Llewellin said he thought the paper which his friend, the Town Clerk, had put into the waste paper basket was worthy of some con- sideration. (Hear, hear.) It was a communication asking the Corporation for an opinion on the Bill for legalising marriage with a deceased wife's sister, and he thought it deserved some answer, for it was a cour- teous communication upon an important subject, one in which many people were deeply interested, and he thought its receipt should at least have been acknow- ledged. It should have been brought before the Board, and as it was never too late to mend, he thought it should be attended to now. If time pressed, he should be prepared to give his opinion upon it at once. Mr. Lewis said time did press, for the Bill was now before the Lords. Alderman Llewellin said be had always been in favour of the Bill himself, and he could not see what objection there could be to it. The law was avoided now in every possible way, and laws which were not consonant with public feeling were not respected, and consequently were of no avail because they were so little regarded; therefore he thought it best that these marriages should be legalised, and he would move that this Corporation petition in its favour. The Mayor concurred in what Alderman Llewellin had said, and expressed his willingness to sign such a petition. Mr. Lewis seconded the motion. Mr. Lloyd was not desirous of expressing an opinion on the merits I of the question before the Board. He only wished to protest against such matters being brought before them, because, as representatives of the ratepayers, he thought they had quite sufficient to occupy their time profitably in considering local matters. The I question before them was of a large and important nature, and one upon which there was great diversity of feeling. Personally he should have no objection to a revision of the law, but, as a representative of the ratepayers, he would rather not give an opinion upon it. The question of local taxation was different, because it affected the interest of all the ratepayers but this other matter was one which did not so affect the general body, and should not be brought before the Corporation as representing the public of New- port. If the Council did this they would find other questions—political questions brought before them on different occasions, and it would lead to a division and political feeling at this Board which he thought I would be very undesirable. As a matter of courtesy he thought the Town Clerk should acknowledge the receipt of the communication, and he thought it should have been laid before the Council when it was received, but he did not think it desirable that the Council should express an opinion upon it, and he would move, as an amendment, that no petition be sent. Aldermau Davis agreed with Mr. Lloyd, and seconded his ammendent. Mr. Lewis thought it absurd to look upon this as a political matter it had been before the House a great number of years, and he thought this Council might express an opinion upon it one way or the other, especially as nearly every other Corporation in the kingdom had done so. Mr. Murphy thought they were all interested in a change in the law, but this, as a meeting of the Corporation, was not the proper place to bring it forward. It was a religious question, and neither politics or religion should be discussed by them as a corporate body-therefore he should decline to vote for it. Alderman Llewellin said it seemed to him to be rather a social question, and he saw no reason why they should not discuss it as they had done the question of education, and the desirability of having a School Board. Alderman Davis That was forced upon the Council. Alderman Llewellin admitted that, but he did not see why they should not consider this question with- out other compulsion than they should feel from a moral sense of duty. They had been told that other Corporations had given an opinion upon it, and he thought such a statement should have some weight with them. That, at least, was tolerably good proof that it was not so much out of place as the gentle- men who had moved and seconded the amendment would lead them to suppose, and he should certainly press his own resolution. Mr. W. Jones saw no objection to this Board giving an opinion oil the question, the same as had been done by other Corporations. On being put to the vote the resolution was carried, the amendment being lost by one. THE FREK LIBRARY. Mr. Wansbrough asked if the Free Library was liable to pay poor's rates, because a demand for X4 15s. had just been made on that account. The Mayer thought there would be ground for an appeal. COLLECTOR'S RETURNS. The Collector reported that during the last fortnight he had received on account of the general district rates the sum of £ 346 10s. 6d. INSPECTOR'S- REPORT. GENTLEMEN,—Patrick McCarthy, of 27, Castle-street, Pillgwenlly, was summoned before the magistrates on the 14th instant, for keeping pigs, so as to be a nuisance, upon his premises. He was ordered to pay the costs, the nuisance having been removed. Five houses have been registered under the provisions of the Sanitary Act, 18G0, viz., one in Mellon-street, one on Mellon's-bank one in Canal-parade, one in George's Buildings, and one in Cross-street. TWenty-seven persons have been served with notic88 to remove nuisances from their premises in town and Pill- gweally, and 23 nuisances have been removed. The common lodging-houses, also the houses registered under the Sanitary Act, I860, are in a satisfactory condi- tion, and free from any contagious disease. \"During the last fortnight the lime brushes have been lent to fifty-seven poor persons in town and Pillgwenlly. I am, gentlemen, your obedient servant, HENRY WILLIAMS, Inspector.\" LEAKING RAILWAY BRIDGES. The Town Clerk read a letter from the Corporation of Swansea, asking this Board to request the Members of Parliament for this district to use their influence in endeavouring to get a clause inserted in the Public Health Bill, with a view to enabling local authorities to get rid of nuisances arising from leaking railway bridges. The reason for this step was the d.ecision recently given in the Court of Queen's Bench in the case of the Aberavon Local Board and the Great Western Railway Company. Mr. Fothergill said it was an important case. The Local Board summoned the Great Western Railway Company before the Magistrates, for a nuisance arising from the water leaking through one of the railway bridges on to the thoroughfare below. The Magistrates convicted and the Company appealed against the decision in the Court of Queen's Bench, where the decision was reversed. The Clerk said the subject did not come within the scope of a Board of Health, because it did not affect the public health, and therefore he did not think they should take any action upon it. Mr. Stone pointed out that they had already de- parted from that line in the last resolution. A resolution was moved by Mr. Fothergill, and seconded by Mr. Stone, to the effect that an applica- tion be made to the Borough and County Members, in accordance with the terms of the requisition. After some discussion, the motion was rejected, and it was pointed out that the public had their re- medy at common law. This was all the business."},

        "full_text":"NEWPORT SCHOOL BOARD ELECTION. JIEErl.VG OF MR. MITCHELL'S FRIENDS. A large and influential meeting of the friends of Mr. Mitchell was held at the Tradesmen's Hall, on Mon- day evening. The chair was taken by Mr. Gratrex, and amongst those present were Messrs. T. C'ordes, H. J. Davis, E. J. Phillips, L. A. Homfray, W. G. Lovell, J. Parsons, T. J. Jones, P. Richards, J. G. Watts, H. Richards, H. Greene, H. James, A. Blake, A. Williams, J. Mills, D. Price, W. Blackmore, W. Evans, Billingham, F. Martin, Horton, Michael, J. Richards, C. Pearse, W. Roberts, J. Davis, T. E. Cooke, Brimblecombe, Flanders, Dugmore, W. Chris- tophers, T. Lancaster, R. J. Chambers, H. Vennor, J. Gough, R. Alger, J. Hopkins, &c., &e. The room was crowded, and the proceedings were most enthu- siastic. The Chairman said he had great pleasure in taking the chair on the occasion. He expressed the hope that all Mr. Mitchell's friends would unite in effort to return that gentleman at the election now before them. (Applause.) Mr. Mitchell then addressed the meeting, and was received with loud applause. He said the election would take place on the 5th of July. This election was put forward as an opportunity to test by vote for vote the principle of paying for religious education. Referring to the Evening Telegram, the most amusing little paper he ever read, he discussed the question of payment for education. The result of School Board schools, on the showing of the writerinyesterday's Tele- gram, would be a rate of ninepence in the pound. Mr. Lyne had come forward proposing to read the Bible in School Board schools. How much of the Bible Mr. Lyne did not say. Were the ratepayers to support such a candidate ? He (Mr. Mitchell) would go to that Board, if returned, to carry out the principles so ably advocated by the late Mr. Fox. (Applause.) These were important days with reference to education, and he was most anxious that the denominational schools should have a fair trial. He had no wish to enter into a contest, but as his friends wished him to come for- ward, he was quite ready to do his share of the arduous work before them. It was for those who were in favour of his views to come forward and do their best to secure the election. (Applause;) Mr. Cordes was received with loud applause, and said they had met for one object—the return of Mr. Mitchell, whose desire was to promote religious educa- tion. On the other side they wanted to separate the secular and the religious in education. His view was that religion should be woven into the texture of a man's life, aud he urged that they should do their utmost to uphold Mr Mitchell. (Applause.) Mr. Alderman Davis said the, town must be can- vassed from end to end, and efforts made to remove tli, -se impressions which had been produced by the un- truthful statements in the Evening Telegram. He had read a few articles in that paper, but he was so dis- gusted with what it had stated that he gave up reading it. If Mr. Mitchell's friends were true to themselves, that gentleman would be returned by two to one. Mr. W. N. Johns, in reply to a question, said he had made inquiries respecting Mr. Shee,\" had ascer- tained that he did not belong to Newport, and was an itinerant spouter going from town to town, forming Good Templar societies. His utterances at the Liberal meeting had, therefore, no significance. (Applause.) Mr. L. A. Homfray said the election required actions, and not words. Addresses would not do much good. They must act. Mr Mitchell's views on education were tiiose which he was sure the town generally would endorse. They regretted the death of Mr. Fox, and now they sought to elect a gentleman who would uphold the opinions of the late lamented member. This contest was not to be put upon the denominational educationists. It was right that they should noimuate a gentleman co occupy a similar posi- tion to the late Mr Fox but having done that, they were willing to wait until the Education Department had decided whether the area of the district should be enlarged. The cost of the election was therefore thrown upon the town by the secular party, Coming to the immediate object of the meeting, he would say this, they could not have a more excellent representa- tive at the School Board than Mr. Mitchell. (Loud applause.) Mr. Mitchell was not only one of the up- holders of the Dos \\V()\"'k: Schools, but he was also an supporter of the town schools and in having Mr. MitchcII at the Sftbool Board they would have a gentleman who would do his best for the interests of denominational schools. (Applause.) In a speech made by a geutleman on the other side, it was sought to throw ridicule upon the efforts of the gentlemen who were erecting the new schools in Newport, by saying that the ratepayers would have to pay one- fourth the cost. They must not, however, be misled by statements of that kind. It was not a fact that one-fourth of the amount would be paid by the rate- payers of Newport it would be paid out of the Con- solidated Fund. (Applause.) Moreover, they should bear in mind that, but for the zeal and liberality of the gentlemen who subscribed to the intended schools for Baneswell and Pillgwenlly, the ratepayers would have had to pay the whole of the cost of those schools. That would amount to more than VO. (Appluise.) So that the fact was, these gentlemen were relieving the ratepayers of a heavy burden that would otherwise have been cast upon them and among the gentlemen who had taken the principal part in this movement was their friend, Mr. Mitchell (Loud applause.) Although there were some persons who did not feel grateful that the taxation of the town was thus lightened, he believed the ratepayers generally I would feel greatly obliged to the gentlemen who bad come forward to erect those new schools. Mr Mitchell had been one of the chief supporters of those schools, and therefore he (Mr. lioiiifrayi urged the friends of Mr Mitchell to be united one and all in returning that gentleman by a large and triumphant majority. (Applause.) In conclusion, he apologised for the un- avoidable absence of Mr. Alderman Homfray, who would do all in his power to aid the return of Mr. Mitchell. (Loud applause.) Mr. Christophers said he had attended to show that he was prepared to support Mr. Mitchell's candida- ture. He greatly desired the maintenance of the religious element in popular education, and did not think that religious should be severed from secular knowledge in the instruction of children. They well knew that Mr. Mitchell entertained similar views he would support religious instruction in existing schools, and would allow Bible reading, and Christian teach- ing based upon the Bible, in School Board schools. On these and like grounds (although possibly not on all the grounds which prevailed with some of his friends) he had pleasure in supporting Mr. Mitchell's candidature. He did this, too, all the more readily because of the indetiniteoess of Mr. Lyne's views on the religious question. That gentleman would, they were told, admit the Bible into School Board schools but in what way lie would employ it, whether he would allow the teacher to give religious instruction from it, and other points, were left to conjecture. When they sought in his address and speeches for light on this point, they met with vapour, cloud, fog, anything rather than elucidation. Such being the case, he had no difficulty in making his choice. (Ap- plause. ) Mr. Watts suggested that the ratepayers should be specially enlightened 011 such questions as compulsory attendance, remission of fees, and denominational teaching. He had heard many enquiries 011 these points. Mr. Mitchell gave satisfactory explanations on the three points referred to. Mr. E. J. Phillips showed the inconsistency of Mr. Lyne and his friends by pointing out the fact that Mr. Lyne, as a magistrate, might order a child to be com- mitted to a Reformatory, but the school to which the child would be sent must be one in accordance with the parents' religion. Then why should those parties seek to deprive honest parents of honest children from exercising a perfectly free choice? (Applause.) He urged them to rally round Mr. Mitchell. Further arrangements for canvassing the town completely were made, and, after a vote of thanks to the Chairman, the meeting separated with three cheers for Mr. Mitchell."},

RIDING WITHOUT REI!'<s.-Daniel Jones was fined 10s. for riding without reins, with a cart drawn by two horses, at Llanvihangel Pontymoile. A Row AT BLAENAVON:—Martha Walker, the land- lady of the Crown Inn, Blaenavon, was charged with assaulting Ann Rees, wife of another publican in the same town.—Complainant said she went into the Crown to look for her husband, when, without a word of provocation, Mrs. Walker sprung at her, and caught her by the throat. William Allen made her let go her hold, but she sprang and throttled her again, and P.C. Coombes had to unloose her hands from complainant's throat.—William Allen and P.C. Coombes corroborated this statement.-For the de- fence evidence was given that some men forced their way into the Crown Inn, after the house was closed, and demanded beer; this was refused, and they began a row. Mrs. Walker then sent for the police to have them cleared out Mrs. Rees, who had been ordered out of the house two or three hours before, returned, saying she wanted her husband, and this irritated Mrs. Walker, who laid hold of her to push her out.—The Bench considered that there were faults on both sides Mrs. Rees should not have gone to the house, and Mrs. Walker should not have used unnecessary violence. The case was dismissed, and the ladies were ordered to divide the costs, and pay 9s. each. Frikndly SOCIETIES.—George Evans, one of the stewards of the Benelit Society held at the Globe Inn, Pontypool, was summoned for non-payment of 17s. 6d. sick pay due to Christopher Cooke, a member of the club.—Mr. Greenway defended, and argued that the club had reason to think that the complain- ant was living in adultery, until his marriage certifi- cate was produced, and he had been expelled for not paying to the funds a sum of 2s. on the marriage with his second wife, which took place, it appeared, about seven years ago. The ground for expulsion was that Cooke had borrowed £20 from the club, and then en- deavoured to repudiate it, but had been obliged to pay it.—The Bench did not wish to say much about the matter, bat they thought that stringent measures had been taken by the club, and they ordered that the money claimed should be paid with costs, and Cooke re-instated as a member of the club. TRUMPERY SQUABBLE. — James Meredith was charged with assaulting Elizabeth Humphries, at Glascoed. These people had foolishly fallen out because their children quarrelled, and complainant said the defendant threw stones at her, while the defendaut said he threw the stones at her dog, which she set at him. -The case was dismissed, and defend- ant was ordered to pay the costs, 7s. LIFE ON THE SOW-HILL —Edward Wheelan and James Wheelan, little boys, were charged with tres-| pass by getting on top of the house of Adelaide Jone's and pulling off the tiles, on the Sow-hdl, Pontypool. —It seemed that Mrs. J ones had got among a set of rather lively Irish neighbours, who annoyed j her in a variety of ways. One of these, Ellen Hay, was so demonstrative in Court that the police had to bundle her out, and the Bench cautioned her not to molest Mrs. Jones. The boys were cautioned, and ordered to pay 6s. each. —Catherine Madden, who did not appear, another of the very agreeable neigh- hours, wis' ordered to pay 12s or seven days, for assaulting the said Mrs Adelaide Jones; and the Bench told Mrs. Jones to let them know if they annoyed her again, and the offenders should be severely punished. MONDAY. (Before Colonel BYRDE and C. J. PARKES, Esq.) Charles Heritage was fined 10s., or seven days, for being drunk and riotous at Pontypool. Richard Ashman, charged with a like offence at Aber- sychan, and James Mulcahy, charged with a similar offence at Pontypool, were each ordered to pay 5s. 4d. costs. Charles Cable was charged with stealing three grow- ing cabbages, the property of his master, John Knipe, at Kemeys Vach.— Mr. Knipe did not wish to press the charge, as the prisoner had been an honest man while in his service, and he might have thought he was doinc no harm.—Fined 10s. -,i_ i Wdliam Pumfrey, a navvy, was charged with steal- intr half-a-quarter of lamb, from the stall of John It appeared that prisaner days' hard labour. he was let off with"},

We have heard that the Board considered the charges proved, and reprimanded the Master, but we are bound to confess that it seems peculiar that the ccmplaints against the Clerk and the Medical Officer for Trelleck should be freely discussed before the Press, and that those against the Master should be discussed in pri- vate..

Mr. Banks, the secretary to the Spinners and Winders' Association, issued his last monthly circular for the year 1875 on the 31st ult, in which he gives a brief summary of the casualties that have occurred in connection with the cotton trade in Preston during the past year. He says:—\"The year (1875) has been most disastrous to cotton spinning by fires in Preston, destroying about 68 pairs of mules, containing nearly 140,000 mule spindles, being equal to the number in motioff of the great leading firm in Preston. This is very much to be deplored, inasmuch as those thrown upon the streets will for some time have a difficulty in obtaining other situations.

During the same period £ 205. lis. 8cl has been paid to members thrown out of employment by fires and breakdowns, and E40 paid to eight members: leaving spinning, besides EGI. lis. 2d., the cost of removing 21 eligible members' goods to other towns where employment has been obtained.\""},

        "full_text":"THE WORK OF THE SESSION. THE idea which appears to have gained cur- rency, and which certain Liberal papers have taken such eonstant care to circulate, that the present is to be a sort of holiday Session, and that Parliament having met only shortly be- fore Easter, would adjourn about the middle of July, was corrected by Mr. DISRAELI, in the House of Commons, on Monday evening. On that occasion the PREMIER made a statement as to the business which he expects will occupy the remainder of the Session; and it was a really formidable array which he presented- although not one of the measures named was of a \"sensational\" or party character. The Bills which are thus to occupy Parliament are seventeen in number of these Mr. DISRAELI enumerated ten as of first-class importance, viz. :-The Licensing Bill, the Friendlv So- cieties Bill, the Factories Bill, the Land Transfer Bill, the Judicature Bill, the Rating and Valuation Bill, the Scotch Church Patron- age Bill, the Land Transfer (Scotland) Bill, the Police (England) Bill, and the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, 011 which it is intended to legislate if the Commission report in time. Besides these, there are seven which may be placed in the second class, namely—the Public Health (Ireland) Bill, the Kegistration of Births (English) Bill, the Irish^Licensing Bill, the Noxious Business Bill, the Shannon Im- provement Bill, the Irish Constabulary Bill, and the Endowed Schools Bill. But besides these, there is tlie Public Worship Regulation Bill, which, although not technically or strictly a Government measure, is yet, as Mr. DIS- RAELI stated, one of commanding interest, brought forward by a high authority-the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURT,\" and which, it is Understood, will practically be dealt with as if 11 a Government Bill. In addition, interesting debates are certain to occur on the Education question, the new Constitution of the Gold Coast, and the Vote for the Post Office and Telegraphs. This is the work which the Go- vernment have set before Parliament to be accomplished, if it be possible, in the forty days for legislation remaining of this Session, -out with this, private members must have time given them, and besides the regular ednesday, the Home Rulers have at least secured the time for one set debate on the in- terminable Irish question. This presents an amount of legislative work to be accomplished which would seem at first view quite impracticable for although the subjects to be dealt with are not of a nature to call forth angry party opposition, they are yet, many of them, of high social and industrial importance, involving great in- terests, and necessarily, in many cases, elabo- rate and complicated details. But, fortu- nately, a leading characteristic of the present Cabinet is administrative capacity, and the business of the Government is being transacted -with a promptitude and efficiency for which, with one or two exceptions, the late Ministers were not remarkable. How during the few months the present Administration have been in office, they have bad time to consider and digest such a number of important measures, in addition to the ordinary, though to them unaccustomed, work of the departments, seems, indeed, a marvel; but we may be quite sure that with regard to all the Bills of which Mr\" DISRAELI spoke, the great work of preparation is already done, and when brought before the House they will be lucidly explained and pro- bably passed without delay. It is not a little amusing to read the com- ments of the London Liberal journals upon the programme of the work of the Session. 'Ihe 1 Baily News, for example, gravely says—\"Mr, DISRAELI and his Government have already Consumed apparently for their own soleg; ati- fication about half the Session.\" When we remember how nearly the entire pre-Easter portion of the Session was sacrificed a; the Consequence of Mr. GLADSTONE'S coup d'état, and how much practical work was actually done between Easter and Whitsuntide, we cannot but be surprised at the coolness of the Radical organ in making such a statement. The Times, too, after rehearsing the 1 st of; measures to be considered and of work to be done, calmly tells its readers, it is not un- I reasonable to believe that, with ordinary eco- 1 Homy in the use of time, the labours of the year may be closed and the members of the Legislature dispersed a fortnight at least before the usual rising of Parliament.\" That is to say, the leading journal\" is t, of opinion that, in a Session reduced, by Liberal misdoing, to little more than two-thirds of the ordinary length, an Admin- istration, called suddenly aild without prepara- tionto office, may bring about a legislative result such as has not distinguished any session of if ?LADST°NE regime. It was conceded on when Mr. DISRAELI entered upon Rn?' tbat but little could be expected from T-S10IX ^sread of being as thus r- ?C' Pr°mises to be more than ordinarily ■u DISRAELI is evidently impelled n 'P^ble ambition to overcome the offi tles which beset him on entering upon one06't0 siolialise the session of 1874 as Thnc°, \"n f most really usefnl upon record, party wh -b0St fulful the Professions of his capacity a™ 'sLesmat\"0\"' pl'0ve his own"},

The amend- JJNENT prOp0sed by the EARL OF SHAFTESBURY, for appointment of a regular judge, who, like an I comn]0-1 jUdge, should visit any locality where mp alnt I .t' ■vpRtLTn^ made of irregularities, to In- indcrmp^f facts> an(i theri and tbere by the AR\",P°utbecase—was cordially accepted bv 119 NR, ?BLSAOP OF CANTERBURY, and carried It ™ ■' HP A ARCHBISHOPS, and is to \"e » mau 0f not less thaa ten years standing- at the bar, with a salary of £ 4,000. As this judge will, of course, base his judg- ment on strictly legal principles, it was felt proper that certain non-essential matters of ritual should be withdrawn from his jurisdic- tion and the BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH, seconded by the LORD CHANCELLOR, suggested that a neutral ground should be fenced off, within which clergymen should be free to con- sult their own feelings and those of their parishioners, without being held liable for any violation of Ecclesiastical law. LORD CAIRNS mentioned two subjects which he thought ought to be included in this neutral region the position of the clergyman during the t,Y r, prayer of consecration in the Communion Service, and the use of the Athanasian Creed. These are concessions to the High Church and the Broad Church party, and to extend equal consideration to the Low Church section, it has been proposed to neutralise the words ob- jectionable to some with regard to Regenera- 0 10 tion in the Baptismal service for children, or the omission of certain words in the Ordina- tion of Priests and the Visitation of the Sick. This is the outline of the scheme, which may nqw be regarded as the joint product of the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, the Earl of SHAFTESBURY, and the BISHOP OF PETER- BOROUGH, with the powerful aid of the LORD CHANCELLOR, and which appears to combine these two advantages—a certain measure of liberty, respecting non-essentials as to which honest differences prevail, and the firm and prompt enforcement of the law, now so openly defied by the small, but troublesome, party of Ritualists. Except this Bill be impeded by factious opposition in the House of Commons, we may expect that a measure will mark the Session of 1874 which will prove of inestim- able value to the Church, and which, without placing grievous restrictions upon the con- sciences of any class of her members, will yet restrain Romish excesses. These, if not sup- pressed, threaten formidable dangers, and de- cisive measures are needed to restore the confidence of Protestant Churchmen, and to quell their fear that the Church is about to be Romanised.\" The great difficulty of the proposed scheme will be the lines which will bound the neutral territory proposed by Dr. MAGEE, and in drawing these there must bo both wisdom and generous forbearance. The conspicuous ability with which this most diffi. cult question was discussed in the House of Peers, and the calm statesmanship by which the whole proceedings were distinguished afforled a new and striking illustration of the value of tte Upper Chamber as an essential part of the Legislature of the country. We haye already borne testimony to the valuable labours of the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, the BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH, the LORD CHANCEL- LOR, and the Earl of SHAFTESBURY, and to these names many others might be added but we cannot omit to mention the name of the late LORD CHANCELLOR, to whom much praise is due.

The intruder was seized, however, by a young man who happened, to be present, but the mouse slipped out of his hand, and, running up his sleeve, came out between his waistcoat and shirt at the neck. The unfortunate man had his mouth open, and the mouse, on the look-out for some convenient place of concealment, entered the man's mouth, and he, in his fright and surprise, swallowed it. That a mouse can exist for a considerable time without much air has long been a popular belief, and was unfortunately proved to be a fact in the present instance, for the mouse began to tear and bite inside the man's throat and chest, and the result was that the unfortunate fellow died after a little time in horrible agony.- Several witnesses having corroborated the above facts, and medical testimony as to the cause of death having been given, a verdict of Accidental death\" was re- turned."},

An inquest was held at Lord Hood's Arms, Bridge street, Greenwich, a short time back, on the body of a man unknown, which was found in a state of nudity with the exception of a shirt, lying on the shore of the Thames, partly under water, off Billingsgate Dock, Greenwich, by In- spector Box, of the Thames Police. At the inquest a verdict of found drowned was returned, the inspector stating a description of the deceased liad been circulated without leading to his identification. He had inquired of those on board a ship lying off Huntley's Wharf near the spot, but he could gain no intelligence of one of the crew being missing. The body has, how- ever, since been identified as that of Charles George Warriker, of the collier brig Star, which up to the 24th instant lay at Huntley's Wharf. It appears that deceased, with two or three ship- mates, went to a public house, and returned to his ship under the influence of drink. One of his companions, who was in the same condition, fell and injured his head, and was removed to the Seamen's Hospital. Deceased was shortly after- wards missed, his clothes being found near his bunk. It is thought that, having undreesed, he accidentally stepped overboard, and was drowned."},

The directors of the Great Northern Railway Com- pany have, after a lengthened agitation on the part of some classes of their men, made certain concessions to them. The guards, shunters, &c., asked the directors for an increase in wages to the extent of 3s. a week all round, and in addition a reduction in the hours of labour to ten per day for guards and eight for shunters, with payment for overtime at the rate of ten hours per day, Sunday duty to be paid for from midnight on Saturday to midnight on Sunday. In response to the men's application, the directors have given the second-class guards an increase of three shillings per week, but only after five years' service- twelve hours to be taken as a day's overtime. Although the wages of the shunters have been increased by Is. a week, their hours of labour-probably the most perilous of railway work—have not been reduced, and their hours stand as before, viz., twelve hours a day, two being given for meals. It appears that while the men are thankful for these concessions they are far from satisfied, especially with respect to the length of the working hours, and further representations upon this point will be made to the directors, who, with the general manager, Mr. Oakley, have always evinced anxiety to favourably consider the case of the men."},

A GALLANT RESCUE.—The rescue of his wife and children by Mr. Wood, the landlord of the Prince of Wales Tavern, Windsor, from his burning house on' the morning of Christmas Eve, is worthy of record. It seems that Mr. Wood slept in a back room upon the first floor, while his wife and children occupied the second floor front bedroom. Mr. Wood was roused from his first sleep by the barking of his dog, and upon opening his door a rush of flamo made him aware of the calamity. Jumping out of the window he took an axe and climbed to the roof between the two houses. His own had a high peaked roof, and as his wife was sleeping in the second floor, Mr. Wood hewed away the quartering at its base, and thus extri- cated his wife and five children from the burning house, the rooms of which were all on fire. The fur- ther escape of Mr. Wood and his family over the lofty peaked roof of the next house and thence to the George the Fourth Inn was also a work of considerable difli- culty and danger, executed as it was amidst the flames, smoke, and burning embers by which they were pur- sued during their retreat to a place of safety. BENEFICIAL El'FECTS OF FREE LIBRARIES IN NOT- TINGHAM.—The Nottingham Free Public Libraries and Museum Committee report the extended usefulness of these popular institutions. The libraries contain 20,5/9 volumes. Of this number 1001 volumes were added during the past year, partly by purchase and partly by gift. It has been found necessary to replace 211 volumes, which by fair wear and tear had become unfit for circulation. Many of these volumes had been in constant circulation from the opening of the library. A number of volumes of no further use for circulation have been forwarded to the Board of Guardians for the use of the inmates of the Union. 692 volumes have been bound, 346 volumes have been restitched and recased. The committee have lent 156 duplicate volumes of magazines for the use of the young women attending the reading rooms of the Nottingham Social Guild. During the year 15 volumes were replaced by borrowers and guarantors. The libraries were available to the public 289 days during the year, during which period 143,096 volumes were issued for home reading and reference in the libraries, being an average daily issue of 495 volumes. This is an increase on the issues of last year of 9375 volumes, and is the highest annual issue that has been reported. New cards of membership of the lending library were issued to 2093 persons during the year.

On their return a sudden squall struck the vessel, capsized it, and threw the whole of the Sarty into the water.

The Spectator thinks the House gains little, by the new creations, but the Order loses nothing, and the country very little, unless it be something of confidence that Mr. Disraeli, even in creating peers, will step out- side routine. There is nothing to surprise anybody in an Irish peer wishing to be a British one, and no reason why the Earl of Erne, if he wishes it, should not be gratified, more especially at a time when the Orangemen of Ireland begin to doubt whether Tories, after all, «re much better than Whigs and there is hardly more reason for condemning the promotion of Lord Wharncliffe than for praising it. It is nor usual to give two steps at once, except, for services which Lord Wharncliffe has not, to the public knowledge, performed, and it is unwise to cheapen the only reward a peer can earp by great public achievements; but when that has been said, criticism has reached its limit. Mr. Disraeli has probably some reason for his action, which satisfies himself and his colleagues in the Upper House, and the change in Lord Wharncliffe's style and precedence does not matter a straw to anybody else. The revival of the Dukedom of Goklon in favour of the Duke of Richmond does, hen ever, matter a little to a good many people, whose comments\" ill not be perhaps wholly untinged with bitterness. The Duke's rank is not increased, for his three other dukedoms, which Madam Carwell\" begged of Charles II., are a trifle older than the Dukedom of Gordon, but the action of the Crown decides in his favour a quarrel which it would have been more graceful to terminate at a time when he was not a Minister. The Duke is thus declared to be the head of the Gordons, to the ex- clusion of the heirs male, the Liberal Marquises of Huntly, who thus see themselves superseded as to the title, as they lately were as to the estates, of the chief of their house. The matter is of no public importance, but the possessor of three dukedoms, even if he thought the claim of the female line the better one, might have waited till he himself could no longer seem even to influence officially the decision of the Crown. Such honours are most becoming after a resignation. The Gordons, however, will, we dare say. light their own battle with the Lennoxes quite well enough, and we only record their supersession a, an evidence that the habit of using opportunities of this kind is not confined to the Whigs, who were once supposed to have a mono- poly amounting to proprietorship in aristocratic selfish- ness. There is no other objection to the Duke of Richmond taking ten dukedoms, if he likes, more par- ticularly as he does not thereby gain even the hundred steps of precedence which must have been Lord Aber- gavenny's temptation to accept a marquisate."},

Ritchie, of Hoyland, deposed to having attended the child some time ago, when she was suffering from erysipelas, arising from wounds. He was called in to examine her recently, and found her to be Buffering from fresh cuts on the face, arm*, and legs. There was a deep wound on tbetleft leg, with two old discharging wounds on the back, and a number of wounds on the face, arms, arid leL's. Several patches of hair were off the scalp, and altogether the girl was ic a very filthy stato. and a pitiful object to look at. Both eyes were dis- coloured, and the child had evidently not had sufficient food.-The prisoner was committed for two months, with hard labour."},

The Bishop of Zululand, preaching on Tuesday in,Chasier Cathedral, expressed his conviction of the necessity of the Zulu war, his only sur- prise being that it did not commence a year before it did. He was sure there was no other nation in Europe that would have borne one-tenth no long and so patiently with Cetewayo as we had ? done. He was in Zululand when the British governor placed Cetewayo as the head of the Zulu nation, and exacted from him solemn pledges that he would be more just in his lule than formerly. One of the most prominent pledges was that he would not indiscriminately slaughter his subjects, but would always use them with j notice and judgment. ( But from the moment they placed him in that position he would have none of their counsel and set at naught their advice. He opposed himself steadily to Chris- tianity and civilisation alike, and he (the preacher) could tell them from personal acquaintance that the wheelmarks of that expedition from Natal had not died away before the King hadgone to his old work of indiscriminately slaughtering his subjects. Cetewayo's reign had been a reign of terror from the beginning, as hardly a month passed during his (the preacher's) stay there but in one part or other of Zululand deeds of blood were done at the King's instance,. _'phe colony of Natal was full of refugees, who had placed them. selves under the protection of our Bag to stem the Violence of the chiefs and their King.

        "full_text":"DESTRUCTIVE FIRES On Saturday evening, the extensive cotton spin- ning mill of Messrs. Armitage and Rigby, at War- rington, was burned to the ground. The mill, which was about 100 yards long and five storeys high, and contained some 30,000 spindles, was situate on Cockhedge, and faced Buttermarbet- street. The flames were first discovered in the fourth storey, and had there been an abundant supply of water, with efficient appartus, the fire migh t easily have been extinguished. As it was, water could not be pumped into the burning building. One engine broke down, and the hose pipes burst in all directions. Consequently, the course of the flames was unimpeded for a time. The whole of the Warrington fire brigade was in attendance, and when everything at last had been got into working order they began to do good service. When it was seen that the fire could not be subdued by the engines on the spot, telegrams were sent to Liver- pool and Manchester for further assistance, but the railway authorities in Manchester are alleged to haverefused to take the engines either by ordinary or special train. Meanwhile the engine from Messrs. M'Corquodale's works at Newton, and one from Messrs. Crosfield's works at Bank Quay, had ar- rived. They were immediately got to work, and did good service at the back of the burning pile, where there was a large reservoir. Despite all the efforts of the firemen, however, the flames continued to spread with great rapidity. The east wing of the building is separated from the other by a partition wall, and it was confidently expected that the course of the fire would be stopped at this point; but, un- fortunately, one of the firemen in beating a hasty retreat from the burning portion forgot to close the airtight doors connecting the rooms. Thus the fire spread into the east wing, and its progress could not be arrested until the entire building had been consumed, with the exception of the engine-honse, which is fire proof. The valuable machinery, of course, was entirely destroyed, as well as all the cotton which was in course of manufacture. About four o'clock on Sunday morning the flames were got under, but the engines continued to play during the day upon the smouldering debris. A large number of bales of cotton were stowed away in safety before the fire reached the place in which they were kept. At one time the danger of the flames spreading to a row of houses in Oxford-street was so imminent that the people become terror- stricken and removed their furniture. This occur- rence will be deeply felt in Warrington, as over a thousand hands will be thrown out of employment. It is impossible to give the exact amount of the damage caused, but it is stated that it will not be less than Jj70,00J or < £ 80,000. The build ng an 1 plant are believed to be fully insured. On Saturday morning, at nine o'clock, a fire, which resulted in damage estimated at aboutY,30,000 broke out in the Sandford Paper Mills, at Sandford near Oxford. 'I he works were carried on by Messrs. Morris and Company. Recently large additions have been made to the premises, an a three- storeyed building had just been erected and fitted with new machinery. It was in the uppermost storey, which was stored with rags, that the fire broke out. In the room underneath was a rag- boiling apparatus, and from this, it is supposed, the mishap arose. Mounted messengers were sent to Oxford, but before the fire brigade arrived the buildings were gutted. Much of the machinery was saved. One of the Oxford volunteer brigade firemen was severely injured. The premise's were fully insured."},

Report of the Graving Dock Committee to the Newport j Harbour Commissioners. \"The Dry Dock Committee met this day, when the I following members Vvere present, viz. :—T. B. Batchelor. Esq., in the chair; and T. Beynon, G. W. Jones, S Hor1- fray, and C Lyne, Esqs. Letters received by Mr. Beynon from Mr. R. D. Baxter, London, were laid before the Committee, from which it appeared that a sum of £25,000 for the constructici of the proposed Dry Dock might be obtained upon loan for 10 years, at Xb per cent. interest; the Harbour Com- missioners paying a commission of .£750 for procuration After full consideration and discussion of the steps necessary for the construction of the Dock, the Committee resolved to report Mr Baxter's offer of loan to the general meeting, leaving it to the full Board to decide as to accepting it or otherwise. In doing this the Committee think it their duty to remind the Board that whilst the time limited by their Act for completing the proposed Graving Dock will not expire until 12th July, 1876, the period within which the necessary land can be acquired under the compulsory powers of the Act, will expire on the 12th July next. The question of taking measures for the acquisition of the site therefore calls for immediate determination by the Board, if the projected dock is to be carried out.\" T B. BATCHELOR. Newport, 18th May, 1871. Chairman. Mr. Batchelor said the meeting was aware that some five years ago the Commissioners obtained an Act of Parliament, at a cost, and that amongst other things 'contemplated the chief was to get extended dry dock accommodation. The necessity for that accommoda- tion was as great now as ever. Relatively Newport was behiud other Bristol Channel ports in that accommoda- tion, and in his judgment they ought not to negi ict the opportunity of acquiring the land, and proceeding with the works. They had the hearty co-operation of the chairman and vice-chairman (Mr. S. Homfrav and Mr. Lyne) in the matter of the land. Those gentle- men rendered the best assistance they could in 1S70, and put such figures before them relative to the cost of the land as showed that the Commissioners need not be discouraged. The only diiffculty in 1870 was the money. That, he was happy to say, had pretty nearly, if not completely, vanished. The Com- missioners bad considerable funds of their own, and now other means were within reach, so that thev might acquire land and carry out the works within the time specified by the Act. They bad only forcy days for acquiring the land, but they had two p'ars to complete the work. It was thought by some that, as considerable dry dock accom- modation had been supplied since 1870, there was not any urgency for the scheme proposed by this body but the strong point in favour of this scheme was, it would be a public dry dock. That would be a great boon to the Old Dock Company and the public generally. He then stated the estimated cost pre- sented to the Commissioners in 1870. Cost of the fee simple of the land, exclusive of the keelage dues and tenant's interest, £ 7,000 value of keelage, £ oS0; compulsory sale, £ 170 total, £ 7,850. Then there was tenant's interest, £ 300, and the Newport Dock Company, £4.50. Cost of dock, 300 feet long, £ 23,500 engineering, &c., £2,000; total, £ 34,100. The esti- mates were afterwards revised, and the cost of the dock rsduced to £ 19,000. Tint was Mr. Abernethy's estimate. Some time afterwards Mr. Schenck was consulted, and he gave an opinion that a dock mirrht be made for £ 12,000. No doubt since then labour and material had greatly increased, but he thought that both had got to the top of the tree, and that there would be a great reduction. He wished the question to be ventilated before proposing a motion. Mr. Colborne asked how it was proposed to repay -the principal and interest ? Mr. Batchelor From the surplus income, which would yearly increase, and also from the income de- rived from the new dock. The Chairman said that Mr. Homfray and himself did not guarantee the cost of the land to be only £ 7,000. They gave their opinion then, but without consulting any one. It was impossible to say what the tenant's interest was worth. Land had greatly- increased in value since 1870. He also reminded the meeting that since then the Newport Dry Dock Com- pany bad made a large dry dock, which had greatly met the wants of the port. At the same time he would not take upon himself to say that a public dry dock was not required. He would, however, urge that the Commissioners should make a large one, if they made one at all—not less than 350 feet in length —as they ought to have reference to the future, and not merely to the present. Supposing they resol/ed to make a dock, where would they get the mone;, to repay the principal and interest ? The surplus income was about £ 900 a year. The Clerk said they had power to charge on all t'r ir works and their revenue. Mr. Colborne moved, \"That the Clerk he instructed to give notices for the purchase of so much land as ne- cessary for the construction of a new dry doc'- and ferry works, in accordance with the views of the Com- mittee as to the area of the land required for a dock not less than 33U feet in length.\" Mr. Pain seconded the motion. Mr. Batchelor said he thought he might state as his opinion that the new dry dock would yield an income of between £ 2,000 and £ 3,000 a year. The motion was carried by a large majority."},

        "full_text":"EXTRAORDINARY SCENE IN THE IRIsH COURT OF CHANCERY. DUBLIN, Tuesday Night.—The Court of Chancery was crowded this morning by barristers and the public in expectation of a scene between the Lord Chancellor and Lord Justice Christian. Judgment was to be delivered on an appeal from the Vice Chancellor, who had refused to make any ruling on a motion to amend a bill, being of opinion that it was a matter not for him but for his Chief Clerk.- The Lord Chancellor expressed his opinion that the Vice Chancellor had discretion to act as he had done.—Lord Justice Christian said this was an in- stance of the faculty of the Lord Chancellor for taking things easy and escaping giving a judicial answer to the question whether the Chief Clerk's offices had not been applied to illegal purposes. One of the greatest blows the Court of Ch mcery in Ireland had received was when it was severed trom its connection with the English bar, for its brightest days were when Lord St. Leonards and other orna- ments of the English bar presided in it. The salary of the office of Lord Chancellor in Ireland was higher than that of the English Lord Chancellor, but the latter received an additional sum for his duties as Speaker of the House of Lords. The Irish Court of Chancery had outlived its usefulness, and the Lord Chancellor could only escape from the drudgery of office work to attend to more attractive duties by illegally referring business to the Chief Cle; k. In his opinion the Lord Chancellor should not be a judge of first instance, but his funct ons should be simply appellate, like those of the Eng- lish Lord Chancellor, and there ought to be two Lords Justices of Appeal of co-ordinate status. His Lordship spoke for two hours.—The Lord Chancellor replied with a warmth which he had never before exhibited on similar occasions. He said he had hitherto exercised the quality of silence out of res- pect to the dignity of the Court, and he would have adhered to that rule still, but that he could not al- low references to judges—past and present, living and dead-which were as irrelevant as they were offensive, to pass without reply. It was too hard that on a wretched point of this kind he and his colleagues should not only be censured for acting wrongly, but should have improper motives at- tributed to them.—The Lord Justice of Appeal said he did not attribute motives but when dealing with public matters he cared not what individuals stood in his way."},

        "full_text":"FIGHTING IN PERSIA. The Vienna correspondent of the London Telepraph writes:—Intelligence reaches me of a sudden and somewhat serious outbreak of dis- turbances in Persia. The chief of the tribe of the Dahtiares, who are within the jurisdiction of Ispahan, had lately given the Persian authorities ground to suspect that he was aiming at inde- pendence. He and his followers had pillaged and laid waste the neighbouring country to the very gates of Ispahan. They had further refused to pay the tribute due to the Persian Govern- ment, although the chief's son was a hostage in the hands of the Governor of Ispahan. The latter, after causing the nomad chief himself to be put to death, sent emissaries to the Dabtiares to inform them that justice had been done, and to urge them to keep quiet and pay the tribute. His emissaries weie massacred. Whereupon the Prince Governor ordered the chief's son to be exeouted also. The Dahtiares, on receipt of the tidings, concentrated at once, and, when the last news left the country, they were marching on Ispahan. The Prince Governor, Till Es Soltanet, had de- spatched a body of troops to oppose their advance. It is not impossible that the Persian Government may thus find themselves in presence of a fresh edition of the Kurdish insurrection, particularly as the territory inhabited by the Dahtiares is admirably well-adapted to partisan warfare."},

A London correspondent writes:—\" I understand that Lord Enfield has written to Lord Elcho propos- ing an alternative plan for the reconstruction of London Municipal Government. Instead of combin- ing the powers of the Metropolitan Board of Works and of the City in one body, he would have two governments, the Corporation remaining pretty much as it is, while the powers of the Metropolitan Board would be largely extended, and the vestries outside the City suppressed, and the members of the board elected directly by the ratepayers. This scheme is not likely to commend itself to the Corporation, because the government outside the City would become so power- ful that it would be sure in the end to swallow up its cribbed and oabined rival. But I am told that it will be submitted to Mr. Cross, who has the matter under consideration at present, and who may come forward with some definite plan of his own in response to Lord Elcho's series of resolutions.\""},

The North-Eastern Railway Company are making extensive alterations for the accom- modation of their goods traffic in Hull, and for this purpose have purchased a large lot of property in English street. A great number of the houses have been untenanted for some time, but on the 11th inst. a Mrs. Anderson, wife of George Ander- son, a labourer in the employ of the company, entered one of them for the purpose of cleaning it, so as to occupy it temporarily. She went up- stairs, and on entering the garret she discovered to her great consternation a man hanging by the neck with a piece of cord tied to a beam. A sickening smell pervaded the room, and the sight was so horrifying that the woman ran into the street and raised an alarm. Several men en- tered the place shortly afterwards, and in cutting the body down it was found to be in an extremely advanced state of decomposition. The features were almost undistinguishable, but subsequently the body was recognised as that of Joseph Smith, 42 years of age, a beerhouse-keeper living in Hessle road. He had not been heard of since the 22nd August, and it is conjectured that on the morning of that date he entered the house in ques- tion and hanged himself.

A despatch dated Chicago, June 3, says A tre- mendous rainstorm passed over a portion of Central Illinois on Saturday and Saturday night, doing great damage to the fences, crops, &e., in the country. At Springfield the cellars and basements were flooded, and in several instances the rain poured into the first floors of the houses, driving the inmates to other apartments. The drains and sewers were overflowed and badly damaged. In the brickyards near the city many thousands of bricks were totally destroyed. A portion of the track ot the Springfield and Illinois South-Eastern Railroad was washed away. Great damage is be- lieved to have been caused throughout the entire section visited by the storm.\" A despatch from St. Louis, also to June 3rd, says Passengers and railroad employes, who arrived from the Last yes- terday and to-day, report an unprecedented heavy rain fall on Saturday night in Central Illinois, covering an area extending from the Wabash to the Kaskaskia river, and from the Toledo and Wabash to the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad. Thousands of acres have been submerged, streams have over- flowed their banks, railroad tracks have been inun- dated, and crops, fences, trees, &c., have been swept away. A report from Winchester, on the St. Louis, Rockford, and Rock Island railroad, savs that some 600 pards of the track near that place' have been washed away. At Bunker Hill, a few miles east of here, over eight inches of water fell.

(Chairman); and JAMES CHARLES HILL, Esq.] Four lads were fined 2s. 6d. each and costs, for stealing apples from an orchard, belonging to Mr. William Giles, farmer, of Risca. William Wait, a ragged and friendless-looking boy, was charged with stealing turnips from a garden, in the occupation of Mr. James Peters.—Fined 5s., or forty-eight hours' imprisonment. William Harvey and James Brake were charged with stealing gooseberries, the property of George Duffield, at Risca. -Sergeant Hale proved the offence. -Fined 2s. 6d. and costs. Elizabeth Williams, of the Sugar Loaf Inn, Risca, was fined 5s. and costs, for assaulting her servant girl, named Jane Thomas.. ALLEGED TRESPASS.—Thomas Richards, in the ser- vice of Mr. Stallard, of Tran Llwyn I arm Christ- church, was charged at the instance of William Richards, gamekeeper, with, trespassing in pursuit of game on Sunday last. — Mr. Cathcart, solicitor, ap- peared for the defence.—The real question at issue, howaver, was not as to the poaching, but as to a right of way, which Mr. Stallard claimed for his farm.- From the evidence given by the complainant, it ap- peared that he saw defendant in a field in the occupa- tion of Mr. Waters, with a double-barrelled gun and a rabbit. He spoke to him, took him by the shoulder demanded his name, and told defendant he should be summoned for trespassing in pursuit of game. De- fendant said All right,\" and gave his name and ad- dress.— Mr. Cathcart, for the defence, submitted that defendant was not in pursuit of game. He only car- ried out the instructions of his master, who had the right of shooting rabbits on his own land, and had sent the defendant to drive off the rabbits and jays from his beans and wheat. There was no secrecy about it, and defendant fired two shots, which at- tracted the keepers, who overtook defendant on the roadway home, and not on the field of Mr. Waters, as alleged. The road was an occupation road, and Mr Stallard had. so occupied it uninterruptedly till last April, when he brought an action against the owners of the Powell estates for damages by game. —James Williams, 88 years of age, was called by the complainant to prove that the roadway in question was no occupation road, and that no per- son had a right of way there.—Mr. Cathcart sub- mitted a map of the land in question to the Bench, and called Howell Williams, 76 years old, to prove that the road was a public thoroughfare, and had been so from time immemorial. An attempt has been recently made to prevent the public from passing, and a coppice had been rooted up and planted with fir-trees in order to do away with the footway, and hence defendant had got into the field in question. Mr. Cartwright, the chairman, after lengthy investigation of the case, said: \"1 consider this case is not proved. Mr. James Charles Hill, who now rents the rights of shooting over these lands, wished to ask if the decision of Bench went further than this, that the defendant was not in pursuit of game. —TheChairman 1 conceive that the summons brought before the Bench was one charging defendant with being in search of game.— That I do not consider proved.—Mr. Hill Then that does not prevent taking out another summons for trespass.—The Chairman I don't think the Bench have any jurisdiction over the right of way. -Mr. Hill instructed the keeper to take out a summons. — The Chairman said there was evidence that the defendant was on the land of Waters, but there was no evidence that he was in search of game.—Mr. Hill: I don't find fault with your Worships decision.—I only want to understand it.—I have no doubt it is a very just decision.—I knew no more about the case than the Chairman when I came here. A DOUBTFUL CASE.—John Price was charged with being found on premises in the occupation of John Clarke of the Star Inn, Maindee, for an unlawful purpose, on Tuesday evening. Mr. Cathcart appeared for the prisoner. P.C. Thomas found prisoner in a stable at night and although Mr. Clark had tirst given him information of a man being on his premises yet, on seeing Price, he refused to give him into custody. The officer on his own responsibility, felt it his duty to take the prisoner in charge. There were some mysterious circumstances about the case which did not ome out in public, and, after a consul- tation between the learned advocate and the Bench, the prisoner was remanded on bail for a week.—We have since been informed that the prisoner was re- quired to give evidence in an important case tried at the Glammorganshire Assizes during the week, and the Bench felt that if prisoner had been convicted on the charge, it might have materially interfered with the furtherance of justice consequently, it was deemed desirable to remand the case for a week. BOROUGH POLICE.—MONDAY. [Magistrates: THOMAS BEYNON, Esq., Mayor, and WILLIAM EVANS, Esq.] WAGES CLAIM.—Samuel Swanton was summoned for jC2 13s. 9d. wages alleged to be due to Henry Tay- lor, for labour performed. Defendant denied the claim. There was some evidence wanting in the case, and an adjournment was ordered till Wednesday. NEGLECTING A WIFE. John Davies was charged with neglecting his wife, and allowing her to become chargeable to the parish of Newport. Defendant's wife was admitted on the 14th May and died in the month of June. Mr. Edward Evans, relieving officer, proved the case. Sentenced to one month's imprison- ment with bard labour, the Bench considering it a very bad case. A DRUNKEN NUISAXCE.-William Morgan, alias Bill the Whistler, was charged with being drunk and trespassing in the yard of the King's Head Hotel. Mr. Gretton, the manager, lodged the complaint, and P.C. Knight proved the case. From the statements made it appeared defendant was a complete nuisance to the place. He had been before the Court on a previous occasion for a like offence. Fined 5s. and oosts, or, in default, imprisonment for 7Jdays. FRENCH NATIONAL FEELING.—Two French seamen named Yras Lourdain and Louis Rio, were charged with singing the national songs of France through the streets and assaulting persons. Chief Superintendent Huxtable stated that a matter of this kind would be- come dangerous unless prevented, and for that pur- pose he had requested Mons. Bourdillon, the French Consul, to attend and endeavour to suppress it. There were a number of other Frenchmen in company, and as they passed through the streets many persons be- came alarmed. There were also Prussian seamen in the port, and if national songs were now sung in this way, it might lead to a collision of an unpleasant na- ture. A woman stated that one of the defendants attacked her and struck her with a boot. For the defence, Lourdain said he was first assaulted and robbed. The Bench discharged Rio, but fined the other defendant 5s. and costs, or 7 days. DRUNKARDS. — Harriett Haggerty and Margaret Thomas were charged with assaulting Mary Moore.- Fined 5s. and 6s. costs each, or seven days.- -Flo- rence Driscoll and Jane Richards were both fined 5s. each for being drunk. ThomasHank,for being drunk and disorderly on Sunday morning, which was proved by P.C. Molland, was discharged with a caution. Daniel Colman was incapably drunk on Saturday and was fined 5s.-Mary Ann O'Brien was charged with being disorderly in Llanarth-street on Sunday after- noon. She was very drunk.-P.C. Brooks brought her to the station.—Sentenced to one month's impri- sonment. George Ingram, for being drunk and dis- orderly in Commercial-street, as proved by P.C. Brooks at about} half-past six o'clock on Sunday eve- ning, was discharged on promising to leave the town. ASSAULTS.—Alfred Speary, for brutally assaulting his wife, Margaret Speary, was remanded in custody till Wednesday. Thomas O'Neill was charged with being drunk and assaulting persons on the docks.- Henry Shannon proved that defendant committed a most unprovoked assault on him.-Defendant said it was hia first offence.-Fined 20s. and costs, or a month. James George Poole, pilot, was charged with assaulting his wife.—Neither party appeared.— It appeared to have been a most aggravated assault, r and Sergeant Franklin proved the service of the sum- mons.-The case was adjourned till Wednesday. Jane Weaver, Elizabeth, Ann, and Rebecca Rees (three sisters) were severally charged with beating William Hendy, and considerably disfiguring him.—It ap- peared that defendants were the occupants of a. brothel and complainant had married a sister of the Rees's. There appeared to have been a fearful row on Satur- day night.—The Bench fined Weaver -0s and costs, or one month, and Elizabeth Rees 10s 6d or fourteen days the other two Rees's were discharged. DISORDERLY.—Catherine Madden was charged with being disorderly in Merchant-street. P. C. Reell proved the offence.—Defendant said it was her own daughter with whom she was quarrelling.—Fined 5s. COAL STEALING.—Ellen Flynn was charged with stealing from a truck, the property of the Monmouth- shire Railway Company.—P.C. Evans saw the priso- ner throwing coal over the railing from a truck, and eventually after watching for some time saw a boy run away with a basket of coal, and he apprehended the prisoner.—Superintendent Hill proved the owner- ship of the coal. It was in the custody of the Mon- mouthshire 'Company, but was in the trucks of the Powell's Duffryn Company, Limited. A quantity of coal was stolen therefrom on Saturday night last. — Prisoner elected to be tried by the Bench, and pleaded not guilty.-—The Bench were of a contrary opinion, and sentenced her to fourteen days imprisonment with hard labour. FEMALE SQUABBLE.—Elizabeth Lyons, for assault- ing Margaret Kelly, was fined 5s. and costs, or four. teen day*. STEALING APPLES.—William Richards was charged with stealing apples from a garden belonging to Mr. Frederick Justice.-A witness said he was on duty in the garden, and he saw twenty boys sitting on a rail near the garden, and he heard some conversation. Prisoner and boy named Edwards volunteered to go into the garden. He was concealed and eventually pri- soner went in. He made a bolt and caught the lad. He took him to Mr. Justice, and he stated that Richards was the boy, to the best of his belief, whom he had caught there before. Witness proved the offence.-Fined 10s. 6d., or fourteen days' imprison- ment. WEDNESDAY. [Magistrates W. WILLIAMS Esq., and Dr. MORGAN.] DRUNK.—David Williams was charged with being drunk and incapable.—Fined 5s. ASSAULTING A WIFE.-Alfred Speary was charged with assaulting and beating his wife, Margaret Speary. —Mr. Bradgate defended.—William J. Lewis deposed that he saw defendant strike his wife on Saturday. He struck her severe blows with his shut fist. Was authorised to attend by the Superintendent.—Harriet Frost deposed that on Saturday afternoon she heard a scream, and saw Mrs. Speary on the ground. Her face was bleeding.—By Mr. Bradgate: Mrs. Speary was drunk. Mrs. Speary said she was blind drunk, and that she and another person had drank 8s. worth of brandy.-P. C. Chamberlain deposed that last witness came to the station and stated that Speary had nearly killed his wife. He saw Mrs. Speary, her eyes were swollen, and one side of her face was double its usual size blood was also running down her cheek. Never saw a person's face in such a state in his life, and he had seen many injured faces. The woman was not very drunk. On seeing this he took defend- ant into custody. -Mr. Bradgate said that Mrs. Speary was very drunk and fell down, thus injuring her face and discolouring her eyes.-Superilltendent Huxtable gave defendant a very bad character.—Fined 20s. in- cluding costs, or in default, 14 days' imprisonment.
